     Preface


The Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences supports research and 
related activities that contribute to a fundamental understanding of life 
processes at the molecular, subcellular, and cellular levels.  
Investigator-initiatedresearch proposals are considered in Cell Biology, 
Biochemistry and Molecular Structure and Function, and Geneticsand Nucleic 
Acids.  The Division also supports fundamental studies leading to technological 
innovation, e.g.,biotechnology.  Scientific emphases include biotechnology, 
biomolecular materials, plant biology, computational and theoretical biology, 
molecular evolution, microbial biology, biodiversity, and environmental 
research.  The Division also considers support for:  research conferences, 
meetings, and workshops, both domestic and international.

The purpose of this Summary of Awards for the Division of Molecular and 
Cellular Biosciences is to provide the scientific and engineering communities 
with a summary of those grants awarded in Fiscal Year 1993.  This report lists 
only those projects funded using Fiscal year 1993 dollars and hence does not 
list multi-year awards initiated prior to Fiscal year 1993.

Similar areas of research are grouped together for reader convenience.  The 
reader is cautioned, however, not to assumethat these categories represent the 
totality of interests of each program, or the total scope of each grant.  
Projects may bridge several programs or deal with topics not explicitly 
mentioned herein.  Thus, these categories have been assigned administratively 
and for the purpose of this report only.

In this document, grantee institutions and principal investigators are 
identified first. Award identification numbers, award amounts, and award 
durations are enumerated after the individual project titles.  Within each 
category, the awards are listed alphabetically by state and institution.  This 
report was compiled from Foundation records.  However, the data included here 
are unofficial.  The Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences is 
responsible for the information cited in this document.

Readers wishing further information on any particular project described in this 
report are advised to contact the principal investigators directly.
