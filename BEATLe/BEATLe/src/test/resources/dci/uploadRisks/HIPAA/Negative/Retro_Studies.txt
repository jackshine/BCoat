were not introduced into Japan in large numbers until after the
Second World War. The chronicity of tobacco use, particularly of
those forms of tobacco that are commonly inhaled, is probably more
important than age per se in producing COLD death. The chronicity
of tobacco use differs in different countries and between men and
women in the same country; these differences would be expected to
result in different COLD mortality ratios.

In several of these prospective mortality studies, the mortality
ratio for COLD deaths in smokers compared with nonsmokers was
even larger than that found for lung cancer. This is consistent with
the data in the previous chapter showing that cigarette smoking is
the major predictor of decline in lung function and is also consistent
with the clinical observation that clinically significant airflow
obstruction is rare in the absence of a history of smoking.

Retrospective Studies

The relationship between smoking and mortality from COLD was
also examined in several large retrospective studies. Wicken (1966)
conducted a study of 1,189 men living in Ireland who died from
chronic bronchitis. Smoking habits were determined through person-
al interviews with relatives of the decedents. The relative risk for
mortality from COLD was increased in smokers as compared with
nonsmokers. Smokers of as few as 1 to 10 cigarettes per day had a
2.95fold higher risk for mortality from COLD as compared with
nonsmokers.

Dean and associates conducted two retrospective studies of the
relationship between changes in smoking patterns and changes in
mortality from bronchitis among a sample of the population in
urban areas and in rural areas of northeast England. The periods of
observation in the two studies were 1952 to 1962 (Wicken and Buck
1964; Wicken 1966) and 1963 to 1972 (Dean et al. 1977, 1978),
respectively. Smoking status classifications in the two studies were
similar, and were based upon questions relevant to the last 2 years
before death or interview. In both studies, the relative risk for
mortality from chronic bronchitis was substantially increased for
smokers as compared with nonsmokers.

In summary, data from both the prospective and the retrospective
studies consistently demonstrate an increase in mortality from
COLD for smokers as compared with nonsmokers. These studies
include populations of widely different ages, social and ethnic
groups, geographic locations, and occupations; nevertheless, they
strongly support a causal relationship between smoking and COLD.

Male and Female Differences in COLD Mortality

Mortality data presented by the National Center for Health
Statistics indicate that in 1980 the number of deaths from COLD was
2.36 times higher among men than among women (9th ICDA nos.
490, 491, 492, and 494496). In the prospective studies reviewed
above, it is also apparent that the relative risk for death from COLD
was greater for male smokers than for female smokers, although
both male and female smokers exhibited a greater risk than
nonsmokers for death from COLD. These differences are most likely
a consequence of differences in male and female smoking patterns.
The women in these studies tended to smoke fewer cigarettes, inhale
less deeply, and begin smoking later in life than the men. They more
frequently smoked filtered and low tar and nicotine cigarettes and
had less occupational exposure to pulmonary irritants than men.
These differences in mortality from COLD are narrowing because of
a more rapid rise in female mortality from COLD (see Table 1).

Figures 6 and 7 help to explain the male-female differences in
COLD mortality ratios in the prospective mortality studies and in
U.S. COLD death rates. The figures are descriptions of the preva-
lence of cigarette smoking in successive lO-year birth cohorts of men
and women as those cohorts progressed through the years 1900-1980
(Harris 1983). Examination of these figures revealed several impor-
tant findings. Relatively few women took up smoking prior to 1930.
The heaviest smoking cohorts of men have a prevalence of over 70
percent compared with 45 percent of women, and the male cohorts
with these peak prevalences are older than the female cohorts.
However, as discussed earlier, the incremental and progressive
nature of cigarette-induced lung injury results in both prevalence
and duration of cigarette smoking having an impact on COLD death
rates. Therefore, in examining Figures 6 and 7 it is important to
consider the span of years of a given prevalence of smoking
maintained by a given birth cohort as well as the peak prevalence
achieved by that cohort. The COLD death rates should then be
proportional to the area under the prevalence curve described by
each cohort, rather than to the peak of that curve.

A careful examination of Figure 6 reveals that the area under the
prevalence curve for the cohort born between 1921 and 1930 is less
than the area under the curve for the cohort born between 1911 and
1920, in spite of their similar peak prevalences. This difference is due
to the more rapid decline in prevalence with age in the 1921 to 1930
cohort. Similarly, the cohort born between 1901 and 1910 partially
compensates for a peak prevalence that is lower than the 1911 to
1920 cohort by having a somewhat a broader base. Each of the
cohorts born prior to 1900 have substantially smaller areas under
their curves than those born during the first three decades of this
century. These differences in prevalence are reflected in the changes

in age-specific death rates portrayed in Figure 8 and Table 5. The
oldest age group (7584) continues to show a rapid rise in COLD
death rates as those birth cohorts with increasing prevalence and
duration of smoking move into this age range. In the age range 65-74
the rates rose rapidly from 1960 through the mid 19708, but seem to
be leveling off, consistent with the fact that this age group is now
made up entirely of men born after 1900. In the age range S5-64 the
rates suggest a slight downturn beginning in the mid 197Os,
coincident with the entry of the 1921 to 1930 birth cohort into this
age group. The numbers for the age range 45-54 are too small to

permit firm conclusions, but also suggest that a downturn in rates
occurred in this group in the late 1960s.

A close examination of Figures 6 and 7 also offers an explanation
of the differences in mortality ratios for men and women observed in
the prospective studies. COLD is a slow, progressive disease, and
death from COLD usually results only after extensive lung damage
has occurred. The fact that death from COLD is unusual prior to age
45 reflects, in part, the 30 or more years required for cigarette smoke
to damage enough lung to result in death. The substantial ventilato-
ry reserve of the lung allows a significant amount of damage to exist
in a person without symptomatic limitation or risk of death from
COLD. The prospective mortality studies were conducted in the
1950s and 1960s a point in time approximately 30 years after the
beginning of the rise in smoking prevalence among women demon-
strated in Figure 7. Even the older cohorts, where significant
mortality might be expected, had begun smoking largely after 1930,
and therefore had a shorter duration of smoke exposure than the
men born in the same years. This shorter duration of the smoking
habit, together with the previously described tendency of women to

smoke fewer cigarettes per day and to inhale less deeply, would be
expected to result in less cumulative lung damage at any given age.
This difference in extent of lung damage could explain the difference
in COLD mortality ratios between men and women observed in the
prospective mortality studies.

The British doctors study examined the risk of COLD death for
male and female physicians who smoked similar numbers of
cigarettes per day (Table 41, and the mortality ratios were similar for
similar numbers of cigarettes smoked per day.

In summary, data from the prospective studies indicate that the:
relative risk of death from COLD is greater for male smokers than
for female smokers. These differences are most likely a consequence
of differences in female smoking patterns. Women tend to smoke-
fewer cigarettes, inhale less deeply, and begin to smoke later in life-
than men. These differences in mortality from COLD are narrowing-
because of a more rapid rise in female mortality from COLD than in
male COLD mortality. This reflects the narrowing in differences
between male and female smoking patterns and the rising preva-
lence of female smokers in successive cohorts born between 1920 and

mortality from COLD over the next decades.

Amount Smoked and Mortality From COLD

Six of the major prospective studies evaluated the influence of
different smoking levels on mortality from COLD. These studies
employed a variety of measures of tobacco exposure, including
number of cigarettes smoked per day, grams of tobacco smoked, and
total number of cigarettes smoked in a lifetime. The data, presented
in Table 4, show a gradient in risk for mortality from COLD as the
number of cigarettes smoked per day increases and as the cumula-
tive number of lifetime cigarettes smoked increases. In the U.S.
veterans study, smokers of two packs or more per day had 22 times
the risk of COLD death of nonsmokers. Furthermore, mortality
ratios between the two followup periods for bronchitis and emphyse-
ma actually increased overall and by the amount smoked (Figure 9).
The authors noted that this was the only major disease of those
associated with cigarette smoking that showed such an increase,
suggesting that mortality ratios have been increasing over time at
all levels of smoking. In the British and Japanese studies, women
smokers at the highest levels exhibited a 32- and an 11-fold higher
risk for death from COLD (respectively) than their nonsmoking
counterparts. The variability in COLD mortality ratios noted in

Table 3 is much less evident when the mortality ratios are presented
by amount smoked.

In summary, the degree of tobacco exposure strongly affects the
risk for death from COLD in men and in women. This clearcut dose-
response relationship enhances the strength of the causal relation-
ship between smoking and COLD.

Inhalational Practice and Mortality From COLD

The inhalation of tobacco smoke is the major mechanism whereby-
bronchial and alveolar tissues are exposed to the potentially
damaging effects of tobacco smoke. In the British doctors study,
subjects who acknowledged inhaling exhibited a 1.53-fold higher risk-
for COLD death as compared with those who stated they did not-
inhale (see Table 6). However, all smokers, regardless of their
inhalational practice, exhibited higher risk for COLD mortality than
did nonsmokers.

In the retrospective study from northeast England (Dean et al.
1977, 19781, the risk among men for mortality from chronic
bronchitis steadily declined with a decrease in the depth of inhala-
tion (Table 7). Among women, the risk for mortality from chronic
bronchitis was lower for all other groups than for those who stated-
they "inhaled a lot."

Results from prospective mortality studies comparing COLD death
rates by inhalation are identical to those observed in the morbidity
studies, which have consistently shown that COLD is more prevalent
among inhalers than noninhalers (Ferris et al. 1972; Comstock et al.
1970; Rimington 1974).
These data suggest that inhalational practice affects the risk of
mortality from COLD. People who inhale deeply experience a higher
risk for mortality from COLD than people who do not inhale.
Regardless of their inhalational practice, however, smokers still
experience higher rates of death from COLD than nonsmokers.

Age of Initiation and COLD Mortality

Another indicator of exposure to tobacco smoke that may influ-
ence risk for mortality from COLD is the age of initiation of smoking.
If their smoking habits are otherwise similar, people who take up
smoking at a younger age have a greater total exposure to tobacco
smoke than those who take up smoking later in life, and might be
expected to experience greater adverse consequences from smoking.
In the Japanese prospective study (Hirayama 19811, men who began
to smoke before the age of 19 exhibited slightly higher mortality
ratios for emphysema than did men who began to smoke after the

age of 20. In the retrospective study from northeast England (Dean
et al. 1977, 19781, the relative risk for death from chronic bronchitis
among men who began to smoke after the age of 25 was 60 percent of
that of men who began to smoke between the ages of 15 and 19.
Among women in the same study who began to smoke between the
ages of 15 and 19, the relative risk for death from chronic bronchitis
was 1.28fold higher than for women who began to smoke after age
25; however, the number of deaths was small.

Smoking Cessation and COLD Mortality

The effects of smoking cessation on mortality from COLD were
examined in the British doctors study and the U.S. veterans study.
In the British doctors study, men who quit smoking experienced no
change in mortality from COLD in the first 4 years and a rise in the
next 5 years; presumably, this is related to the presence of many
people in this group who quit smoking for health reasons (Table 8).
Thereafter, ex-smokers experienced lower death rates from COLD,
although their rates were still higher than those of the nonsmokers.
Female ex-smokers also experienced lower mortality rates than
current smokers, but the rates in ex-smokers were still higher than
those in nonsmokers.

In the U.S. veterans study, ex-smokers who had quit for reasons
other than ill health experienced lower mortality rates for COLD
than did current smokers. However, the benefit of cessation upon
risk for mortality was heavily dependent upon the prior level of
smoking and the length of time of cessation. These data are
presented in Table 9. Ex-smokers who had smoked less than 10
cigarettes per day had a 1.64-fold higher risk for mortality from
COLD than nonsmokers; in contrast, ex-smokers who smoked more
than 39 cigarettes per day had a 9.91-fold higher rate of death from

per day, however, ex-smokers had a lower risk than current smokers.
As in the British study, mortality ratios initially increased over the
first 9 years of cessation. After the first 9 years, mortality ratios for
ex-smokers fell, but never reached the level of the nonsmoker.

Two studies have evaluated mortality rates from COLD among
physicians, a group among whom many quit smoking to protect their
health. Fletcher and Horn (1970) assessed the mortality rates from
bronchitis among physicians in England and Wales. Among doctors
aged 35 to 64, there was a 24 percent reduction in bronchitis
mortality between 1953-1957 and 1961-1965, as compared with a
reduction of only 4 percent in the national bronchitis mortality rates
for men of the same age in England and Wales. Enstrom (1983)
assessed mortality trends from COLD in a cohort of 10,130 physi-
cians in California. The standardized mortality ratio for bronchitis,
emphysema, and asthma among male California physicians relative
to American white men declined from 62 during the period 1950 to
1959 to 35 during the period 1970 to 1979.

In summary, cessation of smoking leads to a decreased risk for
mortality from COLD as compared with that of current smokers. The
residual risk of death for the ex-smoker is determined by the
person's prior smoking status and the number of years of cessation.
However, the residual risk remains larger than that of the nonsmok-
er, presumably because of the presence of irreversible lung damage
acquired during prior smoking.

Pipe and Cigar Smoking Mortality From COLD
Several of the prospective epidemiological studies examined the
relationship between pipe and cigar smoking and mortality from
COLD. The data from these studies indicate that pipe smokers and

cigar smokers also experience higher mortality from COLD as
compared with nonsmokers. However, the risk of dying from COLD
is less than that of current cigarette smokers (Table 10).

International Comparison of COLD Death Rates and Smoking
Habits: The Emigrant Studies

Reid (1971) reported that age-adjusted mortality rates from
chronic nonspecific lung disease among British citizens varied with
migration patterns. British men living in the United Kingdom had a-
chronic, nonspecific lung disease death rate of 125 per 100,000,
whereas migrants to the United States experienced a mortality rate
of only 24 per 100,000, which is similar to the rate found in the U.S.
population. Differences in cigarette smoking and air pollution were
identified as the major factors contributing to the real excess in
bronchitis morbidity experienced by the British in the United
Kingdom. Rogot (1978) conducted a study of British and Norwegian
emigrants to the United States. The mortality rate from chronic
nonspecific lung disease (CNSLD) in Great Britain is about fivefold

212


that in the United States, whereas the mortality rate from CNSLD
in Norway is slightly lower than that in the United States. In
contrast, the British migrant rates were about equal to those of
native-born Americans and the Norwegian migrant rates were the
lowest. Mortality rates for CNSLD were higher for smokers than for
nonsmokers in all groups. These data suggest that ethnic origin
plays a minor role, if any, in determining COLD risk. Regardless of
country of origin, these studies indicate that tobacco smokers
experience higher mortality rates for COLD than do nonsmokers.

COLD Mortality Among Populations With Low Smoking Rates

Numerous studies have reported that certain population groups
who traditionally abstain from cigarette smoking for religious or
other reasons have lower mortality rates from those diseases
traditionally related to tobacco use. The 1982 and 1983 Reports of
the Surgeon General, The Health Consequences of Smoking
(USDHHS 1982, 19831, extensively reviewed this phenomenon as it
relates to cancer and cardiovascular diseases among Mormons,
Seventh Day Adventists, and others. Because Amish are seen as
strict and fundamentalist in outlook, it is assumed that their use of
tobacco is severely restricted. While cigarettes are largely considered
taboo, pipe and cigar smoking and tobacco chewing are widespread
(Hostetler 1968). Hamman et al. (1981) examined the major causes of
death in Old Order Amish people in three settlements in Indiana,
Ohio, and Pennsylvania to determine if their lifestyle altered their
mortality risk compared with neighboring non-Amish. Mortality
ratios from all respiratory diseases were significantly lower by over
80 percent in Amish men 40 to 69 years old, and by 50 percent in
those 70 and older. In the chronic pulmonary disease categories
including emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma, only one Amish male
death occurred, whereas approximately 23 were expected. The
pattern of mortality "om chronic respiratory diseases was similar
for Amish women.

Summary and Conclusions

1. Data from both prospective and retrospective studies consis-
tently demonstrate a uniform increase in mortality from COLD
for cigarette smokers compared with nonsmokers. Cigarette
smoking is the major cause of COLD mortality for both men
and women in the United States.

2. The death rate from COLD is greater for men than for women,
most likely reflecting the differences in lifetime smoking
patterns, such as a smaller percentage of women smoking in

213


past decades, and their smoking fewer cigarettes, inhaling less
deeply, and beginning to smoke later in life.

3. Differences in lifetime smoking behavior are less marked for
younger age cohorts of smokers. The ratio of male to female
mortality from COLD is decreasing because of a more rapid rise
in mortality from COLD among women.

4. The dose of tobacco exposure as measured by number of
cigarettes or duration of habit strongly affects the risk for
death from COLD in both men and women. Similarly, people
who inhale deeply experience an even higher risk for mortality
from COLD than those who do not inhale.

5. Cessation of smoking eventually leads to a decreased risk of
mortality from COLD compared with that of continuing
smokers. The residual excess risk of death for the ex-smoker is
directly proportional to the overall lifetime exposure to ciga-
rette smoke and to the total number of years since one quit
smoking. However, the risk of COLD mortality among former
smokers does not decline to equal that of the never smoker
even after 20 years of cessation.

6. Several prospective epidemiologic studies examined the rela-
tionship between pipe and cigar smoking and mortality from
COLD. Pipe smokers and cigar smokers also experience higher
mortality from COLD compared with nonsmokers; however,
the risk is less than that for cigarette smokers.

7. There are substantial worldwide differences in mortality from
COLD. Some of these differences are due to variations in
terminology and in death certification in various countries.
Emigrant studies suggest that ethnic background is not the
major determinant for mortality risk due to COLD.

introduction

It is usual to think of chronic airflow obstruction as being caused
by airway narrowing or loss of airflow driving pressure-the elastic
recoil of the lung (Macklem 1971J-or both. Lesions of the airways
are often divided into those of the "large airways" and those of the
"small airways." The reasons for this division are both historical and
conceptual. Hogg et al. (1968) showed that in patients with chronic
obstructive lung disease (COLD) the major site of airway obstruction
lay in airways that were peripheral to the wedged catheter that the
researchers used to partition airway resistance. The catheter was
wedged in airways 2 or 3 mm in diameter, and thus the airways
peripheral to the catheter included the smallest bronchi (airways
with cartilage in their walls) and bronchioles (conducting airways
without cartilage in their walls). Since both bronchi and bronchioles
were involved, Hogg and associates used the term "small airways" to
describe them, which has since become a popular term. Conceptual-
ly, lesions of airways may consist of an intraluminal component
(mucus) or a mural component. Most of the mucus in the airways is
thought to be secreted by the tracheobronchial submucosal glands
(Reid 1960); these are mainly confined to airways more than 2 or 3
mm in diameter, or large airways. Because of the documented
association between chronic productive cough and airflow obstruc-
tion (Fletcher et al. 1959), for a long time it was thought by many
that intraluminal mucus was a major source of chronic airflow
obstruction. Thus, the notion developed, without proper substantia-
tion, that central airways obstruction was due to intraluminal
mucus and peripheral airway obstruction was due to inflammation
and narrowing. It is also true that many have equated emphysema
with loss of elastic recoil, but when this has been examined in vivo
(Park et al. 1970; Boushy et al. 1970; Gelb et al. 1973; Berend et al.
1979; Pare et al. 1982) or in excised lungs (Berend et al. 1980; Silvers
et al. 1980), the association has not been close, with some notable
exceptions (Niewoehner et al. 1975; Greaves and Colebatch 1980).
Thurlbeck (1983) reviewed the evidence and argued that loss of recoil
in emphysematous lungs may not be due to the lesions of emphyse-
ma per se but to defects in apparently morphologically normal
intervening lung tissue.

The classical approach to considering the different sites of flow
obstruction is used in this chapter to analyze the relationship
between smoking and the morphologic lesions associated with
chronic airflow obstruction in humans. Lesions of the large airways
(bronchi) are discussed first, followed by small airways, and then by
alveolated structures. It has very recently become apparent that it is
important to include respiratory bronchiolitis as well as emphysema
in the last category (Wright et al., in press); this issue is discussed in
the paragraphs on peripheral (small) airways. Definitions and a brief

223


review of the diseases involved are provided. This chapter attempts
to present the morphologic changes associated with chronic obstruc-
tive lung disease. The detailed epidemiologic and experimental
evidence relating cigarette smoking and COLD are presented
elsewhere in this Report.

Lesions Associated With Chronic Airflow Obstruction
Central Airways
MUCUS

It is convenient to discuss intraluminal mucus and increased
tracheobronchial mucus gland size together, because they are
thought to be related (Reid 1960). Chronic bronchitis is defined as
"the condition of subjects with chronic or recurrent excess mucus
secretion into the bronchial tree" (Ciba Foundation Guest Sympo-
sium 1959). Because there is no way to accurately measure the
amount of mucus secreted into the bronchi, the empirical approach
was taken that production of any sputum was abnormal. Chronic
was defined as "occurring on most days for at least 3 months of the
year for at least 2 successive years" (Ciba Foundation Guest
Symposium 1959). A further qualification was that such sputum
production should not be on the basis of specific diseases such as
tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, or lung cancer.

The initial step was to correlate chronic bronchitis, as defined
above, with lesions in the central airways. This was first done by
Reid (19601, who assessed gland size by comparing the thickness of
the submucosal bronchial mucus glands in histologic sections to the
thickness of the bronchial wall. The latter was defined as the
distance from the basement membrane of the epithelium to the-
inner periochondrium. This measurement is now known as the Reid
Index. This increase has been confirmed by several observers
(Thurlbeck et al. 1963; Thurlbeck and Angus 1964; Mitchell et al.
1966; MacKenzie et al. 1969; Scott 1973), but not by all (Bath and
Yates 1968; Karpick et al. 1970). An important observation was that
there was a distinct overlap in the value of the Reid Index between
bronchitics and nonbronchitics (Thurlbeck and Angus 1964) as
opposed to Reid's 1960 finding that there were two completely
separate groups. In practical terms, this meant that the Reid Index
had limitations in predicting the presence or absence of chronic
bronchitis. More important, it suggested a broad border between-
health (nonbronchitis) and disease (bronchitis). For a variety of
technical reasons (Jamal et al., in press), the Reid Index is a difficult
measurement to use; thus, other measurements of mucus gland size-
were developed. The most popular was the volume density of mucus
glands, i.e., the ratio of area of mucus glands to area of the entire
bronchial wall as seen on histologic slides (Hale et al. 1968; Dunnill

224


et al. 1969; Takizawa and Thurlbeck 1971; Oberholzer et al. 1978).
Other methods included absolute gland size (Restrepo and Heard
1963; Bedrossian et al. 1971) and a radial intercept method (Alli
1975). The size of the acini (tubules) of mucus glands, the number per
unit area, and the ratio of mucus to serous tubules have also been
used (Reid 1960).

The Reid Index, the volume density of mucus glands, and the ratio
of mucus to serous acini have been examined in smokers and
nonsmokers; the results are shown in Table 1. When one considers
the overwhelming association between smoking and chronic bronchi-
tis in living subjects, differences in mucus gland size are insignifi-
cant. For example, three laboratories (Reid 1960; Thurlbeck et al.
1963; Thurlbeck and Angus 1964; Scott 1973) have found a difference
in Reid Index between smokers and nonsmokers; two have not (Bath
and Yates 1968; Hayes 1969). The results from volume density of
mucus glands are clearer-Ryder et al. (1971) found a higher volume
density of mucus glands in both male and female subjects. In
populations of mixed sex, Cosio et al. (1980) and Pratt et al. (1980)
found a higher volume density of glands, but Sobonya and Kleiner-
man (1972) and Scott (1973) did not. When observers have expressed
their morphologic findings as either "normal" or "abnormal" (using
different criteria), the smokers have been significantly abnormal in
all the studies (Field et al. 1966; Megahed et al. 1967; Petty et al.
1967; Vargha 1969). The balance of the evidence is that there is an
increase in mucus gland size in smokers. The discrepancy between
the clinical and the morphologic findings may reflect several factors:
the wide variation in mucus gland size in normal subjects, the
difficulties in measuring the Reid Index and volume density of
mucus glands, the different ways in which the cases have been
collected, and the errors inherent in assessing smoking histories-
from analysis of charts; also, the fact that mucus glands can enlarge
terminally (Helgason et al. 1970) might obscure true differences
between the two groups. In addition, submucosal gland enlargement
is a nonspecific change that can also occur in pneumoconiosis and
cystic fibrosis.

Mucus is also secreted by goblet cells, most of which are in the
major airways. Pratt et al. (1980) showed that goblet cells constituted
10.7 percent of the cells in the central airways of nonsmoking
nontextile workers and 20.4 percent in smoking nontextile workers.
Interestingly, they found an 18 percent frequency of goblet cells in
nonsmoking textile workers; the frequency was about the same in
smokers, whether or not they were textile workers.

Other Abnormalities of Central Airways
A variety of other changes have been described in the central
airways in patients with chronic airflow obstruction, including
