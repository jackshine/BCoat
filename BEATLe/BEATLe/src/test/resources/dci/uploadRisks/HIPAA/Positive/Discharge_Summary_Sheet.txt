Discharge Summary Medical Transcription Report
Medical Transcription Discharge Summary # 1:
DATE OF ADMISSION: 05/05/2014
DATE OF DISCHARGE: 10/30/2014
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Vasovagal syncope, status post fall.
2. Traumatic arthritis, right knee.
3. Hypertension.
4. History of recurrent urinary tract infection.
5. History of renal carcinoma, stable.
6. History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
NAME: G.Margret Ace.
Telephone no: 503-952-6276.
BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 55-year-old female with history of previous stroke;
hypertension; COPD, stable; renal carcinoma; presenting after a fall and possible syncope.
While walking, she accidentally fell to her knees and did hit her head on the ground, near her
left eye. Her fall was not observed, but the patient does not profess any loss of consciousness,
recalling the entire event. The patient does have a history of previous falls, one of which
resulted in a hip fracture. She has had physical therapy and recovered completely from that.
Initial examination showed bruising around the left eye, normal lung examination, normal heart
examination, normal neurologic function with a baseline decreased mobility of her left arm. The
patient was admitted for evaluation of her fall and to rule out syncope and possible stroke with
her positive histories.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: All x-rays including left foot, right knee, left shoulder and cervical
spine showed no acute fractures. The left shoulder did show old healed left humeral head and
neck fracture with baseline anterior dislocation. CT of the brain showed no acute changes, left
periorbital soft tissue swelling. CT of the maxillofacial area showed no facial bone fracture.
Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function, ejection fraction estimated greater than
65%.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Fall: The patient was admitted and ruled out for syncopal episode. Echocardiogram was
normal, and when the patient was able, her orthostatic blood pressures were within normal
limits. Any serious conditions were quickly ruled out.
2. Status post fall with trauma: The patient was unable to walk normally secondary to traumatic
injury of her knee, causing significant pain and swelling. Although a scan showed no acute
fractures, the patient's frail status and previous use of cane prevented her regular abilities. She
was set up with a skilled nursing facility, which took several days to arrange, where she was to
be given daily physical therapy and rehabilitation until appropriate for her previous residence.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: Discharged to skilled nursing facility.
ACTIVITY: Per physical therapy and rehabilitation.
DIET: General cardiac.
MEDICATIONS: Darvocet-N 100 one tablet p.o. q.4-6 h. p.r.n. and Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Medications at Home: Zestril 40 mg p.o. daily, Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, Norvasc 5 mg p.o. daily,
hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. daily, potassium chloride 40 mEq p.o. daily, Atrovent inhaler 2
puffs q.i.d., albuterol inhaler 2 puffs q.4-6 h. p.r.n., clonidine 0.1 mg p.o. b.i.d., Cardura 2 mg p.o.
daily, and Macrobid for prophylaxis, 100 mg p.o. daily.
FOLLOWUP:
1. Follow up per skilled nursing facility until discharged to regular residence.
2. Follow up with primary provider within 2-3 weeks on arriving to home.

patient came to the ER for an episode of vertigo while reaching for some books. The patient
was able to reach the books, to support self, but did not have any syncope. No nausea or
vomiting. No chest pain. No shortness of breath. Came to ER and had a CT head, which was

secondary to proctitis and secondary to decreased appetite. No nausea, vomiting, no
abdominal pain.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED: The patient had a chest x-ray, which showed cardiomegaly with
atherosclerotic heart disease, pleural thickening and small pleural effusion, a left costophrenic
angle which has not changed when compared to prior examination, COPD pattern. The patient
also had a head CT which showed atrophy with old ischemic changes. No acute intracranial
findings.
CONSULTS OBTAINED: A rehab consult was done.

LABORATORY DATA AND RADIOLOGICAL RESULTS: WBC 8.6, hemoglobin 13.4, hematocrit
39.8, platelets 207,000, MCV 91.6, neutrophil percentage of 72.6%. Sodium 133, potassium
4.7, chloride 104. Blood urea nitrogen of 18 and creatinine of 1.1. PT 17.4, INR 1.6, PTT 33.
The patient had a chest x-ray, which showed cardiomegaly with atherosclerotic heart disease,
pleural thickening and small pleural effusion, a left costophrenic angle which has not changed
when compared to prior examination, COPD pattern. The patient also had a head CT, which
showed atrophy with old ischemic changes. No acute intracranial findings.
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT: This is an (XX)-year-old male with syncope.
1. Syncope. This may be secondary to questionable cerebral ischemia/atrial fibrillation/
hypotension, so Neurology was kept on board and the patient was scheduled for a carotid
Doppler and a 2-D echo. Orthostatics were ordered. Vitamin B12, TSH, free T4 and T3 were
ordered along with cortisol level in the morning. FOBT x3 were done and cardiology followup as
outpatient. The patient had a carotid Doppler done on the next day and it showed mild irregular
plaque disease, right and left internal carotid arteries, approximately 20-59%. The patient's
vitamin B12 level came the next morning and the level was 1180. His folate was 18.7 and his
TSH was 1.98, free T4 of 1.38 and T4 level of 7.4, cortisol level of 15.4, which are within normal
limits. Dr. Doe, who is the patient's cardiologist, was informed. Dr. Doe was kind enough to see
the patient the very next day, and his impression was that the patient has atrial fibrillation, rate
controlled, status post AVR, St. Jude, and peripheral neuropathy. Subtherapeutic INR, the
patient's relative target INR is 2-3. He suggested PT evaluation and suggested a low dose of
SSRI and Dr. Doe was of the opinion that the patient does not need any further cardiac
recommendation. CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done. CT chest had an impression of
coronary artery calcification, aortic valve replacement, cardiomegaly, suspect a very small left
pleural effusion, no acute active pulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis showed prior
cholecystectomy, diverticulosis of sigmoid colon, two benign-appearing simple cysts involving
the right kidney, calcified arteriosclerotic plaque disease of the abdominal aorta and iliac vessels
bilaterally. The patient was ruled out of any malignancy whatsoever.
2. Hypertension. The patient at home was on Cardizem ER 90 mg thrice daily, and it was
changed initially to Cardizem 90 mg thrice daily, and then with Dr. Doe's request, we changed
the Cardizem to 240 mg t.i.d.
3. Atrial fibrillation with subtherapeutic INR. The patient at home was on Digitalis. That was
continued. Dr. Doe was of the opinion that the patient himself takes care of the Coumadin, and
Dr. Doe was of the opinion that probably that is why the patient is not able to maintain
therapeutic INR. In the hospital, the patient's warfarin was increased to 5 mg q.h.s., and at the
time of the discharge, he was requested to follow his appointments so that his INR can be
maintained.
4. Gout. The patient was on allopurinol. There were no acute issues regarding the gout.
5. Prophylaxis. The patient was on Protonix and TEDs.
6. Social. The patient is FULL CODE.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Syncope.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient was discharged on the following medications;
Cardizem 90 mg p.o. thrice daily, digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. once daily, allopurinol 100 mg two times
daily, Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.h.s., and Remeron 15 mg p.o. q.h.s.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: Since the patient had generalized deconditioning, the patient
was advised home PT, OT and that was arranged for the patient.
DISCHARGE DIET: Cardiac diet.
DISCHARGE ACTIVITY: Resume activity as tolerated.

showed satisfactory PICC position. Blood cultures x2 showed no growth. Urine C&S showed no
growth. The patient was started on a taper of hydrocortisone. Imuran was restarted. She was
seen by Psychiatry. Creatinine was down to 1.2. The patient was transferred out of the intensive
care unit. She was continued on Claforan, Flagyl and Diflucan. On MM/DD/YYYY, hemoglobin
was 9.2. Hydrocortisone was discontinued and she was put on prednisone. She was seen by
Dr. Doe who recommended TobraDex t.i.d. for 1 week. On MM/DD/YYYY, renal ultrasound was
negative. CT showed increased small bowel thickening. The patient's fever resolved. On MM/
DD/YYYY, hemoglobin was 10.8. The patient was put on IV heparin because of ultrasound of
the upper extremity showing deep venous thrombosis in the cephalic vein on the right. Solu-
Medrol was discontinued on MM/DD/YYYY. She was put on prednisone. Dr. Doe had scoped
the jejunum and found copious mucus and mild colitis. The jejunum was normal to 40 cm. The
patient had heartburn but that was improved. On MM/DD/YYYY, Foley catheter was
discontinued. Physical and occupational therapy was ordered, but the patient could not tolerate
it because of abdominal pain. On MM/DD/YYYY, stool for Clostridium difficile was negative. The
patient received transfusion. Wound C&S grew light growth with MRSA and the patient was
started on vancomycin. Attempt to drain the abdominal cavity revealed no drainage. The patient
was complaining of pain in her hand. She was seen by Dr. Jane Doe who did not find any active
disease. The patient's INR was well controlled on Coumadin, so the heparin has been
discontinued. On MM/DD/YYYY, chest x-ray showed satisfactory PICC position. The patient fell
and injured her knees on MM/DD/YYYY. X-ray of the left knee showed mild degenerative
changes. X-ray of the right knee showed small bony density along the articular surface of the
proximal anterior tibia and mild degenerative changes. The patient has an episode of
hypotension, 84/48, on MM/DD/YYYY. Amlodipine was discontinued, metoprolol was decreased.
She was put back on IV fluids. On MM/DD/YYYY, white count was 4600, hemoglobin 10.2, INR
2.18. Electrolytes were normal. Glucose was 142. The patient continues to have abdominal pain
requiring IV fluids because of the large jejunostomy output. Last blood pressure on MM/DD/
YYYY was 94/50. Abscess fungal culture was negative on MM/DD/YYYY and MM/DD/YYYY.
Myelin-associated glycoprotein was negative. Calcium on MM/DD/YYYY was 8.2.

since infancy, possible environmental allergies, who presented with progressive wheezing and
respiratory distress for the past two days. The patient had been doing well on only p.r.n.
medications per family's report. However, just previous to admission, the patient was exposed to
dust and other particles after moving into a new house. After conservative treatment at home,
the patient was brought into the emergency room where she did not improve on albuterol,
Atrovent treatments or intravenous steroids immediately. Initial examination showed
tachycardia of 128, rest tachypnea of about 35-40, inspiratory and expiratory wheezes and

1. Status asthmaticus: The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit in
moderate to severe respiratory distress with continuous albuterol treatments, Atrovent
treatments q.4 h., Decadron intravenously and empiric treatment of respiratory infection with
azithromycin intravenously. The patient responded to this aggressive treatment and within one
day was transferred to the regular pediatric medical floor. The patient was afebrile with normal
oxygen saturations and appearing much better. Before discharge, she received asthma
education and social counseling along with the family and was connected with social work to
help provide a home nebulizer for use.
2. Empiric respiratory infection treatment: The patient did not show any specific indications of
pneumonia or bronchitis by lab work; however, her initial physical examination showed possible
pneumonia. She was started on intravenous antibiotics and was transferred to oral antibiotics
before discharge.
