GREETINGS, ETC.

1


A THOUSAND AMERICANS WILL STOP SMOKING TODAY.. . .

THEIR FUNERALS WILL BE HELD WITHIN THE NEXT THREE OR

FOUR DAYS.

THAT'S THE WAY I HAVE STARTED A NUMBER OF LECTURES ON

SMOKING.

IT GETS PEOPLE'S AITENTION.

I FEEL I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING DRAMATIC TO'GET THEIR

ATTENTION.


mI SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.

WHAT IS IT ABOUT TOBACCO THAT NUMBS THE AMERICAN

PEOPLE?

IF ANYTHING ELSE KILLED 390,000 OF OUR FELLOW-CITIZENS

EACH YEAR, THE PUBLIC WOULD DEMAND ACTION FROM OUR

GOVERNMENT.

INSTEAD, TOBACCO HAS, FROM THE BEGINNING, BEEN CODDLED

BY OUR GOVERNMENT.


THIS DISTINGUISHED AUDIENCE KNOWS ABOUT THAT,  AND AS A

PHYSICIAN AND FORMER PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER, I DON'T

WANT TO RAISE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE --OR MAKE YOUR

BLOOD BOIL- BY REVIEWING THE SORRY STORY IN GREAT

DETAIL.

BUT IN A FEW WORDS, I'LL REMIND YOU THAT TOBACCO HAS

BEEN ASSOCIATED NOT ONLY WITH DISEASE AND DEATH, BUT

ALSO WITH MONEY.


THAT, OF COURSE IS THE REASON FOR ITS SPECIAL TREATMENT.

TOBACCO WAS THE CASH CROP THAT FINANCED THE AMERICAN

REVOLUTION --THOSE VIRGINIA PLANTERS FETCHED A GREATER

RETURN FOR TOBACCO LEAVES THAN DID THE HARDY NEW

ENGLANDERS FOR THEIR PUMPKINS.

CONGRESS HAS BEEN HELD HOSTAGE EVER SINCE.

DESPITE THE SINISTER ASSOCIATIONS, FIRST WITH SLAVERY, AND

LATER WITH CANCER AND HEART DISEASE, AMERkAN TOBACCO

HAS ENJOYED GOVERNMENT PROTECTION.


TOBACCO MONEY EXPLAINS THE RELUCTANCE OF CONGRESS TO

TOLERATE ANY REGULATION OF TOBACCO, SO IT HAS BEEN

DECLARED TO BE NEITHER A FOOD, NOR A DRUG, NOR A

COSMETIC.

ANY SPEECH ON SMOKING BECOMES A "GOOD NEWS/BAD NEWS"

STORY.

THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE ARE --AT LAST-- WINNING THE WAR

AGAINST TOBACCO.


THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THERE ARE MANY BATTLES STILL TO

FIGHT.

IN MY FINAL YEAR AS YOUR SURGEON GENERAL I WAS

PRIVILEGED TO COMMEMORATE WITH A SPECIAL REPORT THE

25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT

ON SMOKING.

THAT FIRST, HISTORY-MAKING REPORT WAS TITLED "SMOKING

AND HEALTH: THE REPORT OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO

THE SURGEON GENERAL." IT WAS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC ON

JANUARY 11,1964, BY THE LATE DR. LUTHER L. TERRY, A


COURAGEOUS PHYSICIAN WHO WAS SURGEON GENERAL OF THE

U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE AT THAT TIME.


HOW MUCH DID WE REALLY KNOW IN 1944 ABOUT SMOKING AS A

CAUSE OF CANCER?

AND HOW MUCH DO WE REALLY KNOW TODAY?

LET ME BEGIN BY OBSERVING THAT THE FIRST REPORT BY DR

TERRY

DID NOT INITIATE A RESEARCH PROGRAM LINKING SMOKING

WITH MAJOR DISEASE CONDITIONS. SUCH RESEARCH WAS

ALREADY GOING ON.


MEDICAL CONCERN ABOUT SMOKING DID NOT POP OUT OF

NOWHERE IN 1964. LONG BEFORE THAT THERE WAS A CORE OF

CONCERNED PHYSICIANS, ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

CLEAR CONNECTIONS BETWEEN LUNG CANCER AND SMOKING IN

THEIR MALE PATIENTS.

DR. TERRY'S REPORT GAVE NEW ENERGY AND NEW DIRECTION

TO AN ALREADY IMPRESSIVE RESEARCH EFFORT.

IN FACT, AS OF 1964 THERE WERE 7,000 ARTICLES IN THE WORLD


BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE DEALING WITH THE LINKAGE

BETWEEN SMOKING AND HEALTH.


AFTER REVIEWING THOSE RESEARCH PAPERS, THE SURGEON

GENERAL'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE CAME TO THE FOLLOWING

CONCLUSIONS ABOUT CIGARETTE SMOKING IN 1964:

FIRST, THAT MEN WHO SMOKED HAD AN OVERALL HIGHER

MORTALITY RATE THAN MEN WHO DID NOT SMOKE.

SECOND, THAT SMOKERS HAD INCREASED MORTALITY RATES

FROM CORONARY HEART DISEASE, CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE,

AND OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CONDITIbNS.

10


THIRD, THE ADVISORY CO MMITI'EE SAID CIGARETTES WERE A

MAJOR CAUSE OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS AND CONTRIBUTED TO

THE HIGH MORTALITY RATE FOR EMPHYSEMA.

FOURTH, THE COMMIT-TEE SAID -- IN 1964, REMEMBER -- THAT

CIGARETTE SMOKING WAS THE MAJOR CAUSE OF LUNG CANCER

IN MEN AND MAYBE FOR WOMEN, ALSO.

11


FIFTH, THE COMMITTEE ALSO SAID THAT SMOKING WAS, AT THE

VERY LEAST, A CONTRIBUTING CAUSE OF ESOPHAGEAL CANCER,

BLADDER CANCER, AND PANCREATIC CANCER, AND THAT PIPE

SMOKING CONTRIBUTED TO CANCER OF THE LIP AND THE ORAL

CAVITY.

FINALLY, THE COMMWE CONCLUDED THAT "CIGARE'ITE

SMOKING IS A HEALTH HAZARD OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE IN

THE UNITED STATES TO WARRANT APPROPRIATE REMEDIAL

ACTION."

12


SUCH "APPROPRIATE REMEDIAL ACTION" WAS TAKEN ALMOST

IMMEDIATELY. THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS SOON PASSED A

LAW REQUIRING ALL CIGARETTE PACKAGES TO CARRY THE

FOLLOWING MESSAGE:

"CAUTION: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR

HEALTH."

13


SIX YEARS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FIRST REPORT ON

SMOKING AND HEALTH, THE CONGRESS ENACTED A SWEEPING

LAW THAT BANNED CIGARETTE ADVERTISING FROM RADIO AND

TELEVISION.

THE NEW LAW ALSO TOUGHENED UP THE HEALTH WARNING ON

CIGARETTE PACKAGES. THE NEW LANGUAGE SAID...

"WARNING: THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS DETERMINED THAT

GIG-TI'E SMOKING IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH."

14


HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT?

BY 1970, WHEN THE NEW LAW WAS PASSED, THE ORIGINAL BASE

OF 7,000 RESEARCH ARTICLES HAD ALMOST TRIPLED --

APPROXIMATELY 19,000 RESEARCH PAPERS WERE THEN IN THE

INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE -- AND THE NEW MATERIAL WAS

ALSO VIRTUALLY UNANIMOUS IN IDENTIFYING CIGARETTES AS

THE MAJOR CAUSE OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ACROSS A

BROAD SPECTRUM OF DISEASE CONDITIONS.

15


THE NEW INFORMATION NOT ONLY CONFIRMED THE FINDINGS

PUBLISHED IN 1964, BUT ALSO IT LINKED CIGARETTE SMOKING

TO PANCREATIC, GASTRIC, RENAL, AND CERVICAL CANCERS.


CIGARElTES WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED AS THE CHIEF CULPRIT. IN

ATHEROSCLEROSIS . . . IN PEPTIC ULCERS . . . IN COMPLICATIONS

OF PREGNANCY . . . IN INTERACTIONS WITH ALCOHOL AND

CERTAIN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS . . . AND SO ON.

16


IN OTHER WORDS, 6 OR 7 MORE YEARS OF RESEARCH DID NOT

WEAKEN.OR COMPROMISE THE EARLIER FINDINGS. IT MADE

THEM ALL THE MORE FORMIDABLE.

BY THE TIME I ARRIVED IN WASHINGTON IN 1981 TO TAKE UP THE

POSITION OF SURGEON GENERAL, THERE WERE NEARLY 50,000

PIECES OF PUBLISHED RESEARCH WORLDWIDE.

AND AGAIN, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THAT RESEARCH

ONLY STRENGTHENED THE PUBLIC'S CASE AGAINST SMOKING.

17


THE EVIDENCE AGAINST SMOKING BUILDS EVERY YEAR, AND THE

AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE BELIEVING IT.

AS YOUR SURGEON GENERAL I RELEASED 8 ANNUAL REPORTS ON

SMOKING. THEY HAVE DEALT WITH CANCER, CARDIOVASCULAR

DISEASE, CANCER IN WOMEN, SMOKING IN THE WORKPLACE,

CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE, INVOLUNTARY SMOKING

OR WHAT IS SOMETIMES CALLED "PASSIVE SMOKING," AND THE

ADDICTIVE QUALITIES OF NICOTINE.

18


EACH ONE HAS ITS OWN SPECIFIC AND IMPRESSIVE DATA BASE.

TODAY, THE SMOKING-AND-HEALTH RESEARCH BASE IS STILL

GROWING. NOW IT IS COMPRISED OF MORE THAN 60+000

PUBLISHED ARTICLES.  AGAIN, THE VAST MAJORITY QUITE


CLEARLY REINFORCES THE FACT THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING IS

THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR BEHIND ACUTE AND

CHRONIC MORBIDITY AND PREMATURE MORTALITY AMONG

ADULTS.

OR, IN OTHER WORDS, CIGARETTE SMOKING IS THE SINGLE

MOST IMPORTANT REASON WHY AMERICANS GET SICK, THE

SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT REASON WHY THEY DIE BEFORE THEY

SHOULD.

19


AS THIS RESEARCH BASE EXPANDED, SO DID OUR EFFORTS TO

EDUCATE THE PUBLIC . . . TO GET THOSE WHO SMOKE, TO STOP . . .

AND THOSE WHO DON'T SMOKE, TO NEVER START.

IN 1984, I WAS PERSONALLY SO CONVINCED BY THE DATA

ACCUMULATED THUS FAR THAT I CALLED UPON MY FELLOW

CITIZENS TO lMAKE THE UNITED STATES A "1

BY THE YEAR 200Q."

20


WE'LL ACHIEVE THAT SMOKE-FREE SOCIETY BECAUSE WE WILL

GRADUATE A CLASS FROM HIGH SCHOOL IN 2000 THAT WILL

HAVE HAD 12 YEARS OF ANTI-SMOKING HEALTH MESSAGES.

IT STARTED THE YEAR BEFORE LAST, IN THE FIRST GRADE.

TEACHING CHILDREN THAT YOUNG WILL ENABLE US TO WIN.

THE SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORTS ON SMOKING AND THE

WORKPLACE AND ON INVOLUNTARY SMOKING WORKED

TOGETHER TO GIVE THE MILITANT ANTI-SMOKERS NEW AND

POWERFUL WEAPONS.

21


THE NONSMOKER WAS MERELY IRRITATED AT FIRST...THEN

BECAME ANNOYElD...AND THEN TURNED MILITANT.

STUDIES INDICATING THAT PASSIVE SMOKING LED TO 46,000

DEATHS ANNUALLY (3,000 FROM LUNG CANCER, 11,000 FROM

OTHER CANCERS, 32,000 FROM HEART DISEASE) MADE THE NON-


SMOKER MILITANT . ..AND SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING CHANGES


IN SOCIAL CUSTOMS AND IN LOCAL AND STATE LAW.

22


AS OF MID-1988 MORE THAN 230 LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAD

ADOPTED REGULATIONS RESTRICTING SMOKING IN PUBLIC

PLACES, A THREE-FOLD INCREASE IN THREE YEARS.

THE MOST RECENT VICTORY IS THE AIRLINE SMOKING BAN THAT

BECAME EFFECTIVE JUST LAST WEEK (FEB 25,199O).

OF THE 16,000 DAILY FLIGHTS IN THE USA, ONLY 28 SLIP

THROUGH THE BAN, ALLOWING SMOKERS TO FOUL THE AIR.

AND NORTHWEST AIRLINES VOLUNTARILY KEEPS THE CABIN AIR

SMOKE-FREE ALL THE WAY TO HAWAII.

23


AND REMEMBER, LAST NOVEMBER A TOUGH LOCAL SMOKING

CONTROL ORDINANCE WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN

GREENSBORO, N.C., IN SPITE OF HEAVY OPPOSmON BY

TOBACCO COMPANIES.

IF THE TOBACCO COMPANIES CAN BE BEATEN IN NORTH

CAROLINA, THEY CAN BE BEATEN ANYWHERE!

24


SMOKING HABITS HAVE CHANGED.

IN 1964 OVER HALF OF ADULT AMERICANS SMOKED.

WHEN I BECAME SURGEON GENERAL IN 1981, THE NUMBER HAD

DECLINED TO 33 PERCENT.

BETWEEN 1964 AND 1985 APPROXIMATELY THREE-QUARTERS OF A

MILLION SMOKING-RELATED DEATHS WERE AVOIDED OR

POSTPONED BY DECISIONS TO QUIT OR NOT TO START SMOKING.

EACH POSTPONED DEATH REPRESENTED AN AVERAGE GAIN OF 2

DECADES OF LIFE EXPECTANCY.

25



NEARLY HALF OF ALL LIVING ADULTS WHO HAVE EVER SMOKED

HAVE QUIT.

FIFI'EEN YEARS AGO, AT MEDICAL MEETINGS, WHERE DOCTORS

SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETI'ER, THE AIR WAS BLUE WITH SMOKE.

NOW YOU RARELY SEE A PHYSICIAN SMOKE;

THE ONLY SMOKE AT MEDICAL MEETINGS COMES FROM THE

26


FEW THINGS BRINGS ME AS MUCH SATISFACTION AS THE

DRAMATIC DECREASE IN SMOKERS DURING THE LAST 8 YEARS,

FROM 33 PERCENT TO 26 PERCENT.

BUT THERE IS MORE TO DO.

THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF BAD NEWS.

27


SMOKING IS STILL THE SINGLE MOST DEADLY "HABIT" . . .

ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER MORTALITY AND ILLNESS THAN

DRUGS, AUTOMOBILES, AND AIDS COMBINED.

ALL THE AIDS PATIENTS WHO HAVE DIED SINCE WE KNEW ABOUT

THE DISEASE, 8 YEARS, EQUALS THE SMOKING DEATHS OF ONLY

4 MONTHS.

THE NUMBERS OF DEATHS ANNUALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

SMOKING HAVE RISEN WITH EACH SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT.

28


THE NEWEST STATISTICS, THE NEWEST STUDIES ARE GRIM.

THEY DOCUMENT CONCLUSIVELY THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP

BETWEEN SMOKING AND CANCER OF SEVERAL ORGANS.

SMOKING IS A CLEARLY ESTABLISHED CAUSE OF CANCER OF THE

LUNG, LARYNX, ORAL CAVITY, AND ESOPHAGUS.

SMOKING ELEVATES THE DEATH RATES FOR CANCERS OF THE

BLADDER, KIDNEY, PANCREAS, STOMACH, AND CERVIX.

29


FURTHERMORE, PASSIVE OR INVOLUNTARY SMOKING HAS BEEN

ESTABLISHED AS A CAUSE OF LUNG CANCER IN NON-SMOKERS.

PIPE AND CIGAR SMOKERS SUFFER HIGHER RISKS --SOMETIMES

EXCEEDING THE RISKS OF CIGARETTE SMOKERS-- FOR CANCER

OF THE ORAL CAVITY, LARYNX, PHARYNX AND ESOPHAGUS.

THE DATA BASE FOR THESE CONCLUSIONS IS VOLUMINOUS AND

UNASSAILABLE, TRACKING MORE THAN 2 MILLION INDIVIDUALS

IN ALL 50 STATES.

30


THE EVIDENCE MAKES CLEAR THE INCREASED MORTALITY RISK

FACTORS CAUSED BY SMOKING: MALE SMOKERS EXPERIENCE A

22-FOLD GREATER LUNG CANCER MORTALITY RISK THAN MALE

NON-SMOKERS;

AMONG WOMEN SMOKERS THE LUNG CANCER RISK IS 12 TIMES

GREATER.

FORMER SMOKERS ENJOY LOWERED MORTALITY RISKS, THOUGH

NOT AS LOW AS NON-SMOKERS.

WHILE THE STUDIES REVEAL A DOUBLED LUNG CANCER RISK

FOR MALE SMOKERS, AND A 41FOLD INCREASE LUNG CANCER

RISK FOR SMOKING FEMALES, THE LUNG CANCER MORTALITY

RATE FOR NONSMOKERS REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR BOTH MEN

AND WOMEN DURING THE YEARS COVERED BY THE STUDIES.

THOSEWHODONOTUSETOBACCO.

32


OF COURSE, CANCER IS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM.

CIGARETTE SMOKING ALSO LEADS TO DEATH FROM CORONARY

HEART DISEASE.

AND ALTHOUGH THE SMOKING-RELATED RISK FACTOR FOR

CORONARY HEART DISEASE IS LOWER THAN THAT FOR CANCER,

THE NUMBER OF SMOKING-RELATED CORONARY HEART DISEASE

DEATHS IS LARGE SIMPLY BECAUSE CORONARY HEART DISEASE

REMAINS THE GREATEST SINGLE CAUSE OF DEATH IN OUR

SOCIETY.

SMOKING ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 21 PERCENT OF THOSE DEATHS.

33


HOWEVER, THIS DARK CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.

THE PRESENT CORONARY HEART DISEASE AGE-ADJUSTED DEATH

RATE IS 50 PERCENT LOWER THAN IN THE 1960s; THE REDUCTION

IN SMOKING IS A MAJOR FACTOR IN THIS DECLINE.

QUITTING SMOKING REDUCES MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THE RISK

FOR CORONARY HEART DISEASE THAN THE RISK FOR LUNG

CANCER.

FM!, OR TEN YEARS OFF CIGARE'ITES GIVES A RISK FACTOR

SIMILAR TO THAT FOR THOSE WHO NEVER SMOKED.

34


THIS DECLINE HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT WHERE LUNG

CANCER, NO LONGER CORONARY HEART DISEASE, IS THE SINGLE

LARGEST CAUSE OF EXCESS MORTALITY AMONG AMERICAN

SMOKERS.

CONTINUING OUR GOOD NEWS/BAD NEWS THEME, THAT GOOD

NEWS --ABOUT LOWER RATES OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE

BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE STOPPED SMOKING-- IS FOLLOWED BY

SOME NEW BAD NEWS, ESPECIALLY ABOUT WOMEN.

35


THE CONTINUING INCREASE IN LUNG CANCER AMONG WOMEN

SMOKERS IS PARTICULARLY ALARMING BECAUSE THE

MAGNITUDE OF THE RISK IS SURPRISING.

WOMEN BEGAN TO SMOKE IN GREAT NUMBERS ABOUT THREE

DECADES LATER THAN MEN, SO WE ARE SEEING ONLY NOW THE

CONSEQUENT INCREASE IN SMOKING-RELATED ILLNESS.

RECENT STUDIES REVEALED A DECLINE IN MORTALITY RATES

FROM LUNG CANCER IN MALES UNDER 55, WHILE AMONG

WOMEN THE RATE INCREASED BY 30 PERCENT.

LUNG CANCER HAS NOW SURPASSED BREAST CANCER AS A CAUSE

OF DEATH IN WOMEN.

36


WE MUST ENVISION A CATASTROPHIC EPIDEMIC OF LUNG

CANCER AMONG WOMEN IN COMING YEARS.

THIS EPIDEMIC IS AS PREVENTABLE AS IT IS PREDICTABLE.

DISCOURAGING STUDIES INDICATE THAT SMOKING IS ACTUALLY

INCREASING IN SOME SECTIONS OF THE FEMALE POPULATION,

AND THAT OVER-ALL SMOKING PREVALENCE AMONG WOMEN

MAY EXCEED THAT AMONG MEN WITHIN 5 YEARS.

37


A FINAL CONCLUSION OF THE NEWEST RESEARCH IS THAT

SMOKING A MAJOR CAUSE OF STROKE (CEREBROVASCULAR

DISEASE).

WE ESTIMATE THAT SMOKING IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF

OF ALL STROKES OCCURRING IN PERSONS UNDER 65 YEARS OLD.

SO, EVEN THOUGH WE'VE MADE PROGRESS, AS A SOCIETY WE'RE

STILL BURDENED WITH THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

SUFFERING AND HARDSHIP THAT GOES ALONG WITH ALL THESE

DEATHS...

38


THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA ARE STILL BURDENED WITH THE

ECONOMICS OF SMOKING.

WE STILL HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY TO PAY THE

ANNUAL SMOKING-AND-HEALTH BILL OF $39 BILLION.

THAT'S FOR PERSONNEL AND MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY AND

INSURANCE AND LOST WAGES...ALL THE REAL, BASIC COSTS

LEVELLED AGAINST US ALL BY DISEASE AND DISABILITY.

39


SOME 50 MILLION AMERICANS STILL SMOKE, SO OUR EDUCATION

CAMPAIGNS AND OUR SELF-HELP GROUPS MUST CONTINUE

THEIR GOOD WORK.

WE MUST GUARD AGAINST COMPLACENCY, AND INTENSIFY OUR

EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE THE GREATEST CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE

DISEASE AND DEATH AFFLICTING OUR SOCIETY.

40


AND THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS NOT GIVEN UP.

I DOUBT THAT YOU CAN FIND A MORE HEAVY-HANDED, OBTUSE,

IMPOLITIC, AND UNTRUTHFUL GROUP OF CORPORATIONS

ANYWHERE IN THE GREAT PANOPLY OF AMERICAN PRIVATE

ENTERPRISE.

41


ALMOST FROM MY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE, THE INDUSTRY

REMINDED ME AGAIN AND AGAIN -- AND NOT VERY SUBTLY

EITHER -- THAT I OUGHT TO GET OFF MY ANTI-SMOKING "HOBBY-

HORSE," AS ONE TOBACCO LOBBYIST CALLED IT, AND PAY

ATTENTION TO OTHER, ALLEGEDLY MORE IMPORTANT PUBLIC

HEALTH MATTERS.

ECHOES OF THEIR COMPLAINTS WERE RELAYED TO ME FROM


THE WHITE HOUSE, THE CONGRESS, AND EVEN FROM MEMBERS

OF THE PRESS, WHO HAVE OFTEN BEEN THE GULLIBLE CARRIERS


OF THE INDUSTRY'S DISASTROUS MESSAGE.

42


I ALSO READ THEIR DECEPTIVE, FULL-PAGE ADVERTISEMENTS

THAT LIFTED MENDACITY AND HALF-TRUTHS TO A NEW AND

HIGHER LEVEL OF FAUSTIAN ART.

TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, I DID NOT ASSUME THE POSITION OF

SURGEON GENERAL WITH THE CLEAR INTENTION OF BEING SO

PRO-ACTIVE AN OPPONENT OF TOBACCO AS I HAVE BEEN. BUT

THEN I BEGAN TO STUDY IN SOME DEPTH THE

INCONTROVERTIBLE TRUTHS ABOUT THE HEALTH HAZARDS OF

SMOKING.

43


AND I MUST TELL YOU THAT I WAS AT FIRST DUMBFOUNDED AND

THEN PLAINLY FURIOUS AT THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY FOR

ATTEMPTING TO OBFUSCATE AND TRIVIALIZE THIS

EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION.

HOW COULD THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY DARE TO DISMISS AS

UNFOUNDED AND UNPROVEN THE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR

CONNECTION BETWEEN SMOKING AND HEART DISEASE . . .

BETWEEN SMOKING AND DEATHS FROM STROKE . . . BETWEEN

SMOKING AND CANCER OF THE LUNG, THE MOUTH, THE

ESOPHAGUS, AND OF THE STOMACH . . . AND BETWEEN SMOKING

AND A DOZEN OR MORE SERIOUS, DEBILITATING, EXHAUSTING,

EXPENSIVE, AND HUMILIATING DISEASES?

44


HOW COULD THEY DARE TO DO THAT? I WONDERED.

THE ANSWER WAS . . . THEY JUST DID.

AND THEY FLAUNTED THEIR ABILITY TO BUY THEIR WAY INTO

THE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS AND POLLUTE IT WITH THEIR

FALSE AND DEADLY INFORMATION.

AS RECENTLY AS TWO WEEKS AGO, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE

TOBACCO INTERESTS COMPLAINED THAT THE WORD "ADDICTION"

IS INAPPROPRIATELY APPLIED TO SMOKING BECAUSE IT MAKES

TOBACCO SEEM LIKE HARD DRUGS.

45


THEY KNOW THAT ITB ADDICTIVE LIKE HARD DRUGS.

THEY ARE AS SLEAZY AS EVER.

THE 1988 SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT OFFERED IRREFUTABLE

EVIDENCE THAT NICOTINE HAD ALL THE ATTRIBUTES OF AN

ADDICTIVE DRUG . . . IN OTHER WORDS, CONSTANT SMOKING WAS

CLINICALLY AN ADDICTION.

46


POPULAR FOLKLORE HAD PREDICTED SCIENCE:

FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE HAD TALKED ABOUT GETI'ING

"HOOKED" -- AS THE SAYING GOES -- ON CIGARETTES, AS THEY

GET "HOOKED" ON HEROIN, COCAINE, MARIJUANA, AND

ALCOHOL.

THE ADDICTION REPORT PRESENTS CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT

THE PHARMACOLOGIC AND BEHAVIORAL PROCESSES THAT

DETERMINE TOBACCO (NICOTINE) ADDICTION ARE SIMILAR TO

THOSE PROCESSES THAT MAKE COCAINE AND HEROIN

ADDICTIVE.

47


THE DEFINITIONS USED IN THAT REPORT ARE NOT MINE.

THEY ARE NOT IN ANY SENSE ARBITRARY.

TOBACCO IS AN ADDICTIVE DRUG, ACCORDING TO THE

STANDARD DEFINITION OF DRUG ADDICTION ADOPTED BY THE

WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC

ASSOCIATION, AND THE A.M.A.

48


IN OTHER WORDS...

*   TOBACCO IS A "MOOD-ALTERING" SUBSTANCE . . .




*   SMOKERS ARE COMPULSIVE IN THEIR USE OF TOBACCO . . .




*   TOBACCO REWARDS THE USER -- IT IS, THEREFORE, A


      "REINFORCING" SUBSTANCE . . .

*   SMOKERS BUILD UP A TOLERANCE TO NICOTINE AND, FROM

TIME TO    TIME, WILL REQUIRE HIGHER DOSE LEVELS TO


         GET THEIR NICOTINE "HIGH" . . .

49


*   PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE CAN OCCUR, WHICH MEANS A


   WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME FOR THOSE WHO QUIT . . .




*   AND -- AS WITH HEROIN, COCAINE, AND OTHER ADDICTIVE


   DRUGS -- THE USER WILL VERY LIKELY RELAPSE AND


          RETURN TO THE USE OF THE DRUG.

I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA NEED TO

BE WARNED REPEATEDLY ABOUT THE ADDICTIVE NATURE OF

                      L

TOBACCO. AND THE NON-SMOKERS NEED TO DO ALL THEY CAN

TO GET THE SMOKERS TO STOP.

50



NOW, LET'S TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO.

IF YOU HAVE A BUSINESS, SIT DOWN WITH YOUR EMPLOYEES

NOW, AND SET A TIME-TABLE TO MAKE YOUR WORKSITE SMOKE-

FREE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE IMPACT ON YOUR BUSINESS.

ONLY GOOD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.

51


ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO MR. WILBUR MCPHERSON, THE OWNER


OF.RADAR ELECTRIC CO. OF SEATTLE DECIDED TO RID I-IIS

BUSINESS OF SMOKERS. HE KNEW THAT SMOKERS WERE LESS

EFFICIENT, LOST MORE TIME IN ABSENTEEISM, COST MORE IN

HEALTH BENEFITS.

SO HE SIMPLY SAID, "NO SMOKING".

MOST OF HIS SMOKING EMPLOYEES QUIT SMOKING.

ABSENTEEISM DROPPED, MAINTENANCE COSTS DROPPED,

PRODUCTMTY WENT UP.

52


YOU ALL PROBABLY KNOW THE SUCCESS STORY OF THE NON-

SMOKERS INN, LOCATED IN DALLAS, ON THE WAY INTO TOWN

FROM THE DALLAS-FORT WORTH AIRPORT.

ALTHOUGH SCOFFERS PREDICTED BANKRUPTCY FOR A NON-

SMOKERS INN, WITHIN SIX WEEKS THE OWNER USED ONLY

BLACK INK.

THE SUPPORTING FIGURES SHOW WHY.

BUSINESS ECONOMISTS HAVE CALCULATED THAT A SMOKING

EMPLOYEE COSTS A FIRM ABOUT $4,600 PER YEAR MORE THAN A

NON-SMOKING WORKER.

AND THE SAYINGS ON MAINTENANCE, CLEANING, ETC. CAN

AMOUNT TO 41 PERCENT A YEAR.

53


DOCTORS HAVE AN ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT, PIVOTAL ROLE TO

PLAY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST SMOKING IN THIS COUNTRY.

AND IT IS A PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY DEMANDING A

PERSONAL COMMITM ENT AND A PERSONAL APPROACH.

THOSE OF US IN THE ANTI-SMOKING MOVEMENT, THOSE WHO

ARE DOING ALL THEY CAN IN CESSATION PROGRAMS SEE THE

YEAR 2000@ A GOAL FOR MANY OF US.

NOW FOR SOME GOOD NEWS.

THE AIM OF OUR EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS HAS CHANGED

RECENTLY.

FOR THE LAST 25 YEARS WE HAVE TRIED TO CONVINCE

AMERICANS TO STOP SMOKING --AND NEVER TO START.

NOW WE KNOW THAT MOST SMOKERS --PERHAPS AS HIGH AS 90

PERCENT-- WANT TO STOP.

THEY DON'T NEED CONVINCING.

THEY NEED HELP IN SMOKING CESSATION.

56


SINCE 1982 THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE'S SMOKING,

TOBACCO, AND CANCER PROGRAM HAS FOCUSED ITS RESEARCH

ON METHODS OF INTERVENTION:

AMONG THEM ARE:

-SCHOOL-BASED PREVENTION:

WE KNOW THAT THE AVERAGE AGE FOR THE INITIAL

SMOKING    EXPERIENCE GETS LOWER EACH YEAR. ANTI-

SMOKING EDUCATION  MUST BEGIN IN THE ELEMENTARY

GRADES.

57


-SELF-HELP METHODS:

SEVERAL NATIONAL MAGAZINES RECENTLY HAVE

HIGHLIGHTED THESE   UNIQUELY AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS.

  THE ADDICTED SMOKERS NEED TO QUIT THEMSELVES.

BUT IT CAN TAKE ABOUT 5 TIMES TO QUIT, SO THEY NEED

HELP.

58


THEY CAN GET IT IN

-COMMUNITY INTERVENTIONS:

AMONG THE MOST PROMISING ARE THOSE OF COMMIT

(COMM-UNITY INTERVENTION TRIAL FOR SMOKING CESSATION).

THIS IS A MULTI-FACETED EFFORT BASED ON 11

COMMUNITIES IN  THE USA AND CANADA, USING EXISTING


COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS    LIKE WORKSITE GROUPS,

HEALTHCARE FACILITIES, CMC GROUPS,   LOCAL MEDIA, AND

SCHOOLS.

59


ALL THESE GROUPS COOPERATE IN CESSATION EFFORTS

AIMED   ESPECIALLY AT PEOPLE WHO SMOKE 25 OR MORE


CIGARETTES A DAY, THOSE WITH THE GREATEST CANCER RISK,


THOSE WHO HAVE THE  TOUGHEST TIME QUI'ITING.

THE IDEA IS TO SURROUND THEM, EVERYWHERE THEY GO,

WITH    REMINDERS --AND ASSISTANCE-- TO TAKE CHARGE OF


THEIR LIVES  BY CEASING TO SMOKE.

60


COMMIT ALSO URGES PHYSICIANS TO ASSUME THEIR NATURAL

ROLE AS COMMUNITY LEADERS BY BECOMING PART OF THE

LOCAL MEDIA.

COMMIT CALLS PHYSICIANS TO BECOME "SMOKING CONTROL

MEDIA ADVOCATES".

COMMIT SPOKESMEN ASSERT THAT DOCTORS NEED TO APPEAR

ON TV, ESPECIALLY LOCAL TV, TO CARRY THE ANTI-SMOKING

MESSAGE, TO URGE PEOPLE TO QUIT.

                      L

61


PEOPLE BELIEVE DOCS ON TV.

(REMEMBER HOW WHEN ROBERT YOUNG TOOK THE JOB OF

PLUGGING SANKA, MOST AMERICANS THOUGHT IT WAS DR.

WELBY, AND THEY PAID ATTENTION.)

TELEVISION AND RADIO ARE WHAT SHAPE THE AMERICAN MIND.

SMOKING ADS MAY HAVE LEFT THE AIRWAYS, BUT AGGRESSIVE

ANTI-SMOKING MESSAGES NEED TO TAKE THEIR PLACE.

MEDIA ADVOCACY IS ACTIVIST, SURMOUNTING THE THRESHOLD

OF MEDIA RESISTANCE OR INDIFFERENCE, SURMOUNTING THE

OBSTACLES OF PHYSICIAN RELUCTANCE OR INDIFFERENCE.

62


THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE ASSIST PROGRAM
                                        --

AMERICAN STOP SMOKING INTERVENTION STUDY FOR CANCER

PREVENTION-- FOCUSES ON COMMUNITY-BASED COALITIONS

DEALING WITH ENTIRE STATES OR LARGE METROPOLITAN

AREAS.

THESE CENTERS ARE FUNDED IN EXCESS OF $100 MILLION TO

ENSURE A SUSTAINED IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF MORE THAN 50

MILLION AMERICANS.

ASSIST AMOUNTS TO THE LARGEST INTERVENTION EFFORT EVER

UNDERTAKEN BY AN AGENCY OF THE US PUBLIC HEALTH

SERVICE.

THERE &!$ HELP OUT THERE FOR THE SMOKER WHO WANTS TO

STOP.

63


AND FINALLY,

-PHYSICIAN/DENTIST INTERVENTIONS.

THAT LAST-MENTIONED METHOD SHOULD BE OF SPECIAL

INTEREST TO ALL THE PHYSICIANS HERE THIS MORNING.

WE KNOW THAT NOTHING IS AS EFFECTIVE IN STOPPING

SMOKING AS WHEN A DOCTOR LOOKS A PATIENT STRAIGHT IN

THE EYE AND SAYS,

"IF YOU CONTINUE TO SMOKE, YOU'RE GOING TO KILL

YOURSELF.   YOU NEED TO STOP....NOW."

64


THAT CAN WORK WHEN ALL ELSE SEEMS TO FAIL.

THERE ARE NEW METHODS TO ASSIST QUI'ITERS, RANGING FROM

AVERSION THERAPY USING ELECTRIC SHOCKS TO

EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACEUTICAL AGENTS.

BUT, STILL, 85 PERCENT OF THOSE WHO QUIT.. JUST DO IT!

I CALL UPON THE PHYSICIANS WHO ARE HERE TODAY TO CARRY

THAT MESSAGE TO EACH OF YOUR PATIENTS WHO STILL SMOKE.

65


FINALLY, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES THAT

DEMAND OUR RESOLUTE ATTENTION AND ACTION.

ONE OF THEM IS CIGARETTE ADVERTISING.

THE ADS HAVE GONE FROM TELEVISION, THANK GOD, --

ALTHOUGH THEY ARE SNEAKING BACK THROUGH VIDEOS-- BUT

CIGAREXTE ADVERTISING STILL ASSAULTS OUR SOCIETY IN

PRINT AND BILLBOARDS.

66


THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY SPENDS $4,000 PER MINUTE ON

PROMOTION ($2.5 BILLION A YEAR)

ONLY THE GROTESQUE ECONOMIC POWER OF THE

INTERNATIONAL TOBACCO COMPANIES CAN SUSTAIN THIS

OUTRAGE, AS THEY USE ECONOMIC BLACKMAIL TO INTIMIDATE

PUBLISHERS AND GOVERNMENTS.

67


I AM PARTICULARLY DISTURBED BY CIGARETTE ADVERTISING

THAT TARGETS VULNERABLE GROUPS WITHIN OUR POPULATION:

YOUNG PEOPLE, WOMEN, AND MINORITIES.

CIGARETTE F'IRMS MANIPULATE MINORITIES, WOMEN, AND

YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE HAVE THE STRONGEST

ASPIRATIONS TO CHANGE THEIR STATUS.

68


SO THESE ADS ASSOCIATE SMOKING WITH MAKING IT...

IN THE WHITE, OR ANGLO, OR MALE, OR ADULT WORLD.

THEY ASSOCIATE SMOKING WITH A HIGHER ECONOMIC STATUS

(WHEN REALLY HIGHER INCOME GROUPS ARE NOW SMOKING

LESS).

69


WE KNOW THAT THOSE WITH MORE EDUCATION TEND TO QUIT

MORE READILY. "THE MORE YOU KNOW, THE LESS YOU SMOKE."

BUT TOBACCO ADVERTISERS ASSOCIATE SMOKING --CONTRARY

TO ALL EVIDENCE-- WITH ROBUST ACTIVITY, ATHLETICS, SOCIAL

ACCEPTABILITY, SUCCESS, OUTDOOR LEISURE, AND EVEN GOOD

HEALTH.

70


ONE OF THE MORE OUTRAGEOUS ADVERTISING GIMMICKS IS

ONE CIGAREmE COMPANY'S "ALIVE WITH PLEASURE" THEME.

THIS IS CLEARLY AN EFFORT TO UNDERMINE THE SURGEON

GENERAL'S WARNING ON EACH PACK

TRUTH IN ADVERTISING SHOULD REQUIRE, NOT "ALIVE WITH

PLEASURE", BUT "DYING IN AGONY".

71


IN THE ADVERTISING WARS YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT PROOF.

THE TOBACCO COMPANIES SAY THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN

THAT ADVERTISING INCREASES CIGARFXIE SMOKING.

OF COURSE, THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS ISSUE OF HUMAN

BEHAVIOR WILL PROBABLY PRECLUDE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A

SCIENTIFIC PROOF OF A CAUSAL LINK.

BUT TO MY MIND THE BURDEN OF PROOF SHOULD BE ON THE

TOBACCO INDUSTRY TO SHOW THAT ADVERTISING DOES NOT

INCREASE CONSUMPTION OF A PRODUCT THAT WE KNOW LEADS

TO DEATH WHEN USED AS INTENDED.

72


IN THE 1850s JOHN SNOW ENDED THE CHOLERA EPIDEMIC IN


LONDON BY REMOVING THE HANDLE OF THE BROAD STREET

WATER PUMP, 30 YEARS BEFORE THE BACTERIUM CAUSING


CHOLERA WAS DISCOVERED.

FORTUNATELY HE DID NOT NEED TO CONTEND WITH A CHOLERA


INSTITUTE THAT DEMANDED THE PUMP KEEP WORKING UNTIL IT


WAS PROVED THAT WATER FROM THE PUMP WAS CAUSING THE

CHOLERA.

73


AT THIS POINT THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES TROT OUT THE OLD

LINE THAT THEIR ADVERTISING IS INTENDED ONLY TO ENFORCE

BRAND LOYALTY, AND TO GET CONSUMERS TO SWITCH TO THEIR

BRAND.

NO ONE REALLY BELIEVES THAT.

BRAND CHANGERS FORM ONLY A TINY FRACTION OF THE

MARKET.

THE REAL PURPOSE OF CIGARETTE ADVERTISING TO IS HOLD ON

TO THOSE SMOKERS ALREADY HOOKED --ADDICTED-- AND TO

A'ITRACT NEW ONES.

74


IT WORKS.

RECENT STUDIES CONFIRM THAT INCREASED ADVERTISING

BRINGS ABOUT A HIGHER DEMAND FOR CIGARETTES IN

GENERAL, NOT J-UST FOR THE BRANDS ADVERTISED.

WE KNOW ADVERTISING IS EFFECTIVE, AND THEY KNOW IT IS

EFFECTIVE, BECAUSE OF THE BRIEF EXPERIENCE WITH COUNTER-

ADVERTISING IN THE 1960s.

75



EARLY IN THE DEBATE ABOUT CIGARETTE ADVERTISING ON TV,

THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE RECEIVED EQUAL TIME FOR

COUNTER-ADVERTISING ABOUT THE HEALTH PROBLEMS CAUSED

BY CIGARETTE SMOKING.

THE RESULTS WERE SO DEVASTATING TO THE TOBACCO

INDUSTRY, THAT THE CIGARETTE FIRMS DECIDED THEY WOULD

RATHER HAVE NO ADVERTISING AT ALL ON TV, RATHER THAN

HAVE THE TRUE EFFECTS OF SMOKING BROUGHT BEFORE

AMERICAN VIEWERS.

76


(I WILL ADD PARENTHETICALLY THAT WE ARE NOW AT ABC

THE SAME STAGE WITH ALCOHOL ADVERTISING NOW.

FOR THE SAKE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, LET'S HOPE WE CAN


MOVE EVEN FASTER TO RESTRICT ADVERTISING FOR THIS OTHER

ADDICTIVE DRUG.)

77


IN CALLING FOR RESTRICTIONS ON CIGARETTE ADVERTISING I

STAND ON COMMON SENSE AND PROVEN HEALTH STUDIES.

I DON'T NEED TO HIDE BEHIND THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

I DON'T NEED TO USE OUR CONSTITUTION AS A SMOKE SCREEN.

AND THE "FREE SPEECH" ARGUMENT USED BY TOBACCO

ADVERTISERS Is A SMOKE SCREEN.

YOU DON'T SEE THESE PEOPLE OUT IN FRONT ON OTHER FIRST

AMENDMENT ISSUES.

78


FREE SPEECH HAS NEVER BEEN AN UNLIMITED RIGHT:

WE ALL KNOW YOU CAN'T YELL "FIRE" IN A CROWDED THFATRE.

FREE SPEECH CANNOT INJURE THE COMMON WELFARE TO SERVE

THE COMMERCIAL INTERESTS OF A FEW.

THE FIRST AMENDMENT WAS NOT INTENDED TO ALLOW LIES TO

BE FOISTED ON THE PUBLIC.

MOST CIGARETTE ADVERTISING IS LIES.

IT ASSOCIATES WITH ROMANCE, GLAMOUR, ATHLETICS, SUCCESS

SUBSTANCES WHICH INSTEAD LEAD TO DISABILITY AND DEATH.

79


FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTION IS NOT EXTENDED TO SPEECH

ENCOURAGING ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.

TOBACCO ADVERTISERS DEPEND UPON REACHING YOUNG

PEOPLE.

MOST OF THOSE WHO SMOKE BEGAN BEFORE THEY WERE

TWENTY, OR EVEN 15.

IN OTHER WORDS, THE CONTINUED STRENGTH OF THE TOBACCO

MARKET DEPENDS ON THOSE TO WHOM THE PRODUCTS CANNOT

BE LEGALLY SOLD.

80


THEREFORE, RESTRICTIONS ON TOBACCO ADVERTISING MEET

THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEST IN AT LEAST TWO WAYS:

1. IT IS APPROPRIATE TO BAN COMMERCIAL SPEECH THAT IS

MISLEADING OR FRAUDULENT.

AND

2. IT IS APPROPRIATE TO BAN COMMERCIAL SPEECH

RELATED TO      ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.

81


FOR ALL THEIR TALK ABOUT "FREEDOM", TOBACCO INTERESTS

ARE GREAT ENEMIES OF FREEDOM.

FAR FROM BELIEVING IN FREE SPEECH, TOBACCO ADVERTISERS

USE THEIR ECONOMIC CLOUT TO FORCE PUBLISHERS NOT TO

PRINT ARTICLES ABOUT THE REAL CONSEQUENCES OF SMOKING.

CIGARETTE ADVERTISING, FAR FROM ALLOWING FREE CHOICE,

ACTUALLY UNDERMINES FREE CHOICE.

NICOTINE ADDICTS DO NOT ENJOY FREE CHOICE.

82


FINALLY, LET'S BE UP-FRONT ABOUT THE SPECIAL CHALLENGE

FACING TOBACCO ADVERTISERS:

MOST PEOPLE WHO USE THEIR PRODUCT WOULD RATHER NOT

USE IT.

AS MANY AS 90% WISH TO QUIT.

MANY TOUGH IT OUT, BREAK THEIR ADDICTION, AND SUCCEED IN

QUITTING.

83


THE ADVERTISERS NEED TO REPLENISH THE DIMINISHING

SUPPLY OF TOBACCO USERS:

REMEMBER THOSE 1,000 SMOKERS WHO DIE EVERY DAY.

MEANWHILE, ADVERTISERS RECRUIT MORE VICTIMS.

84


WE MUST ALSO CONCERN OURSELVES WITH THE EXPORT OF

TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

I DO NOT BELIEVE THE UNITED STATES WILL EVER AGAIN BE A

GOOD MARKET FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

THE CURVE IS GOING DOWN AND ACCELERATING.

BUT IF WE HAVE BEATEN THE CIGARETTE INDUSTRY ON ITS OWN

HOME TURF WE'VE DRIVEN THEM TO SCOUR THE REST OF THE

EARTH FOR NEW VICTIMS.

85


THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY -- AS YOU ALL KNOW, I AM SURE -- HAS

TARGETED THE LESS DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

OF THE WORLD AS THEIR MOST PROMISING MARKETS FOR THE


1990s.

IT IS THE HEIGHT OF HYPOCRISY FOR THE UNITED STATES, IN

OUR WAR AGAINST DRUGS, TO DEMAND THAT FOREIGN NATIONS

TAKE STEPS TO STOP THE EXPORT OF COCAINE TO OUR

COUNTRY WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WE EXPORT NICOTINE, A

DRUG JUST AS ADDICTIVE AS COCAINE, TO THE REST OF THE

WORLD.

86


ANOTHER ISSUE OF PUBLIC POLICY ON WHICH WE NEED TO SET

OUR SIGHTS CONCERNS CIGARETIX VENDING MACHINES.

HERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE CODDLED CIGARETTE

COMPANIES.

IT IS ILLEGAL TO SELL BOTH ALCOHOL AND CIGARETTES TO

MINORS. THAT IS BECAUSE ALCOHOL AND NICOTINE ARE THE

TWO MAJOR LEGAL ADDICTING DRUGS IN OUR SOCIETY.

87


WE WOULD NEVER TOLERATE SELLING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES

IN VENDING MACHINES, BUT SOMEHOW WE TOLERATE

CIGARE'ITE VENDING MACHINES.

IT IS SAD EVIDENCE OF OUR FAILURE TO TAKE SERIOUSLY THE

DANGERS OF SELLING THIS ADDICTING DRUG NICOTINE TO

MINORS.

THE CIGARETTE VENDING MACHINES SHOULD BE THE NEXT

TARGET IN THE CRUSADE AGAINST SMOKING.

88


NO DOUBT IN THE SESSIONS THAT FOLLOW, YOU CAN DEVELOP

MORE COMPLETE TACTICS FOR THESE AND OTHER STRATEGIC

ISSUES.

I MAY HAVE HUNG UP THE UNIFORM OF THE SURGEON GENERAL,

BUT I HAVEN'T RETIRED FROM THE FIGHT AGAINST SMOKING.

TOGETHER, WE& GOING TO WIN IT.

THANK YOU.

extra stuff in case you need/want to slip it in somewhere:

  AND THOSE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL,


THANKS TO THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF . . .

*   GOVERNMENT ALL LEVELS -- FEDERAL, STATE AND


LOCAL . . . *   THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS, WITH THE


AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ITSELF LEADING THE

WAY . . .

*   MANY PRIVATE, NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS


THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, THE AMERICAN HEART

ASSOCIATION, AND THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION

HAVE ALSO BEEN INVOLVED NOT ONLY IN EDUCATION BUT

ALSO IN SMOKING CESSATION PROGRAMS . . . *  AND


                               PRIVATE

INDUSTRY HAS

90


BECOME A

PARTNER AS

WELL,


ESPECIALLY

THE

INSURANCE

INDUSTRY,

WHICH OF

COURSE LOSES

MONEY ON

PEOPLE WHO

SMOKE.

THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT

OVER THE PAST 25 YEARS . . . IMPORTANT IN BOTH POSITIVE AND

NEGATIVE WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, . . .




      *   GOVERNMENT HAS RAISED EXCISE AND SALES TAXES

91


ON CIGARETTES, MAKING CIGARETTES MORE AND MORE OF

A PAINFUL POCKETBOOK ISSUE FOR SMOKERS, ESPECIALLY

THOSE SMOKERS WHO ARE STILL UNCONVINCED BY THE

OVERWHELMING RESEARCH DATA AVAILABLE. EVEN SO,

TAKES WOULD HAVE TO BE DOUBLED TODAY, JUST TO KEEP

UP WITH INFLATION.

*   GOVERNMENTS -- FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL -- HAVE


SEVERELY RESTRICTED THE AREAS WHERE PEOPLE CAN

SMOKE IN PUBLIC. AT THIS TIME, ALL 50 STATES PLUS THE


DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAVE SOME KIND OF LAW

RESTRICTING SMOKERS IN SOME WAY OR PROHIBITING

SMOKING IN CERTAIN PUBLIC PLACES ALTOGETHER.

IT. IS NOW ILLEGAL TO SMOKE ON MOST PUBLIC

CONVEYANCES . . . IN MOST RETAIL STORES AND

RESTAURANTS . . . IN VIRTUALLY ALL GOVERNMENT

BUILDINGS . . . IN ALL THEATERS AND SPORTS CENTERS . . .

92


AND IN MANY PLACES WHERE PEOPLE WORK.

*   GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO ORDERED NEW AND STIFFER


HEALTH WARNINGS TO BE ROTATED AMONG CIGARETTE

PACKAGES AND ALL ADVERTISEMENTS. AND I LOOK

FORWARD TO "ADDICTION" BEING ADDED TO LABELS BY

THIS CONGRESS.

THAT'S QUITE A GOOD RECORD . . . AND I'VE JUST TOUCHED

UPON A FEW HIGH SPOTS. BUT GOVERNMENT -- AND HERE I

MEAN JUST OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT -- HAS ALSO DONE A

FEW NEGATIVE THINGS. FOR EXAMPLE...

*   ITHASEXCLUDEDTOBACCOANDTOBACCOPRODUCTS


FROM CERTAIN REGULATORY ACTIVITIES COVERING

HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND FROM MOST

PACKAGING AND LABELING RESTRICTIONS, EXCEPT FOR

THE SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING.

93


*   TOBACCO, BY FEDERAL LAW, IS ALSO NOT

CONSIDERED TO BE EITHER A FOOD, A DRUG, OR ANY


OTHER KIND OF CONSUMER PRODUCT. IT REMAINS A

UNIQUE SUBSTANCE, VIRTUALLY OUTSIDE THE REGULATORY

ENVIRONMENT. AND IN OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT,

THAT MEANS OUTSIDE STATE AND LOCAL REGULATION AS

WELL.

94
