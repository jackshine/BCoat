Introduction 
The Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 (MCSIA), P.L. 106-159, mandated a study to 
determine the causes of, and contributing factors to, commercial motor vehicle crashes. The U.S. 
Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) conducted a multiyear, nationwide study 
of factors that contribute to truck crashes. The Large Truck Crash Causation Study’s (LTCCS) 
goal is to identify effective crash countermeasures. 

The LTCCS was conducted at 24 data collection sites in 17 States by researchers from NHTSA’s 
National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) and State truck inspectors. Crash data were 
coded in two NASS quality control Zone Centers and reviewed by FMCSA and NHTSA personnel 
and national truck crash experts. 

The LTCCS collected data on crashes from 2001 through 2003. An attempt was made to ensure 
that each crash involved at least one large truck with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 
10,000 pounds, and resulted in at least one fatality or at least one incapacitating or non-
incapacitating but evident injury. Data were collected on up to 1,000 elements in each crash. To 
get the highest quality data possible, the onsite investigations began as soon as possible after the 
crash occurred. Data collection was performed at each crash site by a two-person team 
consisting of a trained researcher and a State truck inspector. Researchers collected data at 
crash scenes through driver, passenger, and witness interviews. 

Subsequent to the crash, each truck and truck driver were subjected to a thorough inspection. 
After leaving the crash scene, researchers collected additional interview data by telephone from 
motor carriers responsible for the trucks and surrogate drivers of trucks and other vehicles when 
the actual drivers could not be interviewed as a result of a fatal or serious injury. Researchers 
also reviewed police crash reports, hospitals records, and coroners’ reports. In addition, 
researchers often revisited the crash scene to make more accurate scene diagrams and search 
for additional data. 

Together the teams collected data on approximately 1,000 variables on each crash. Crash case 
data were provided to NHTSA crash experts for coding, difficult cases were reviewed by NHTSA 
and FMCSA headquarters staff, and finalized cases were sent to DOT’s Volpe National 
Transportation Systems Center for inclusion in the study’s electronic database.

Programmers' Introduction to the LTCCS User's Manual and Data 

Table Design 

There are 1070 crashes documented in the Large Truck Crash Causation Study (LTCCS) 
database. Each of these is assigned a unique CaseID. There were 2284 vehicles involved in the 
study crashes, each of which is assigned a VehicleNumber (from 1 to 30). Any vehicle in the 
database can be uniquely identified by CaseID and VehicleNumber. There are 3014 vehicle 
occupants and 53 non-motorists in the study. Each occupant is assigned an OccupantNumber 
(from 1 to 11). Each non-motorist is assigned a NonMotoristNumber (from 1 to 7). Occupants 
can be uniquely identified by CaseID, VehicleNumber, and OccupantNumber, and non-
motorists by CaseID and NonMotoristNumber. The database further identifies 2777 distinct 
events, each of which is one in a sequence of events which occur in the course of a crash. Each 
of these events can be uniquely identified by CaseID and EventSequence. 

When joining (i.e. merging) tables one must match those elements which uniquely identify 
records in the table, e.g. joining the VehicleEvents table with the GeneralVehicle table 
requires matching by common CaseID and VehicleNumber. 

There is one crash-level table, Crash and each row in this table corresponds to a single crash. 
This is the single most general, or "top-level" table. All other tables give finer levels of detail, with 
multiple rows per crash. The level of detail of the rows of a particular table can be determined by 
the introduction to the table given in the User's Manual. A description of the variables which must 
be taken together to uniquely identify each record are also given there. 

Variable Reference 

The LTCCS database (LTCCS DB) is released in three formats, SAS, MS-Excel, and plain text. 
Many of the values in the LTCCS DB are numeric codes corresponding to some meaningful value 
description. These values are captured by the SAS version of the LTCCS DB, but not the MS-
Excel or text versions. To assist users of the study data, a LTCCS DB Variable Reference table 
has been created for the Excel and text versions, which lists the LTCCS tables and variables with 
their code values and descriptions. By using this Variable Reference one may determine the 
meaning of a particular variable code value. This reference is automatically included in both the 
MS-Excel and text format download packages. 

Avoiding Difficulties 

It is recommended that the User's Manual be consulted carefully, rather than relying on intuitive 
interpretations of variable names. Most variables have integer values. In some cases these are 
literal values, e.g. counts. In others, these values are codes representing some other value which 
can be found in the variable reference. For example, the variable OCCFatality in dataset 
Crash does not represent the number of fatalities in the crash, but rather, whether there were 
any fatalities, as well as whether any fatalities were ruled due to disease rather than injury. 

Vehicle body type is identified by GVEBodyType in the GeneralVehicle dataset. By the 
methodology of the LTCCS large trucks are those with values for GVEBodyType = {60, 61, 62, 
63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 74, 78}.

Examples 

All Trucks, Simple Count 

This algorithm obtains a simple, un-weighted count of the large trucks involved in the LTCCS. It 
demonstrates how to use the GVEBodyType variable to identify a particular vehicle as a large 
truck, and how to use the RATWeight variable to filter out invalid cases. Only cases with a 
positive RATWeight are valid for the purpose of the study. Invalid cases were included for 
purposes of qualitative analysis. 

1) Access GeneralVehicle table. 

2) Select only cases with values for GVEBodyType = {60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 70, 74, 
78}. Depending on the programming environment used this may be more easily implemented by 
selecting cases where (GVEBodyType >= 60 & GVEBodyType <= 78 & GVEBodyType <> 65). 

3) Select only cases with values for RATWeight > 0. 
4) Count all remaining cases. This gives the unweighted number of large trucks in the LTCCS. 
5) Sum all values for RATWeight. This gives the weighted number of large trucks involved in 

serious crashes nation-wide. 

There are 1123 large trucks in the LTCCS. There are an estimated 141,200 large trucks involved 
in serious crashes nation-wide over the 33 month study period. 

Trucks by Vehicle Configuration 

The purpose of this table is to categorize large trucks involved in the LTCCS by vehicle 
configuration type, e.g. single-unit or tractor-trailer, and to give unweighted counts of the number 
of large trucks in each category. Single-unit vehicles are classified by their number of axles. 
Combination vehicles by the number of trailers being towed. 

1) Access TruckUnits table. 

2) Mark all vehicles with at least one value of AxlesUsed = {7, 8, 9}. 

3) Select only cases with values for RATWeight > 0. 

4) Create variable AxleCt. If AxlesNotUsed <= 3 then set AxleCt = AxlesUsed + 
AxlesNotUsed, else set AxleCt = AxlesUsed. Please note: values greater than three for 
AxlesNotUsed are not valid counts of axles. They indicate that the axles were not inspected, 
that this variable is not applicable, or that the count of axles not used is unknown. 

5) Count number of axles for each vehicle by summing the number of axles for each unit 
constituting that vehicle. 

6) Perform inner join (i.e. merge) of results with Overview table. 

7) Classify vehicles as follows: 

a. Vehicles with a single unit, a value of OVEConfiguration = 'R', and AxleCt = 2 are 
classified as "Single Unit - Two Axles", 
b. Vehicles with a single unit, a value of OVEConfiguration = 'R', and AxleCt > 2 are 
classified as "Single Unit - Three or More Axles", 
c. Vehicles with a single unit, a value of OVEConfiguration = 'R', and the number of 
axles is unknown (results from Step 2) are classified as "Single Unit - Axles Unknown", 
d. Vehicles with a value of OVEConfiguration = 'Not Insp' are classified as 
"Other/Unknown/Missing", 
e. Vehicles with a value of OVEConfiguration = 'T' are classified as "Combo Truck -
Truck Tractor (bobtail)", 
LTCCS Analytical User's ManualProgrammers' Introduction to the LTCCS User's Manual and Data • 5 


f. Vehicles with a value of OVEConfiguration = {'RF', 'RO'} are classified as "Combo 
Truck - Truck Pulling Trailer(s)", 
g. Vehicles with a value of OVEConfiguration = {'TO', 'TS', 'TSA'} are classified as 
"Combo Truck - Tractor pulling Trailer", 
h. Vehicles with a value of OVEConfiguration = {'TSAS', 'TSCS', 'TSF', 'TSXS'} are 
classified as "Combo Truck - Tractor pulling Two Trailers", 
i. Vehicles with a value of OVEConfiguration = {'ISS', 'ROO'} are classified as 
"Other/Unknown/Missing" (please note that the two cases included here, one instance of 
ISS and one instance of ROO may appear to fall under specific categories, but a review 
of the case discussion, CrashDiscussion.Discussion, shows them both to be 
unique and unusual cases and therefore valid instances of 'Other'). 
8) Sum vehicle counts in each classification and calculate percentage for each classification 
by dividing its count by the total number of large trucks (1123). 

Results are given in table 1 below. 

Table 1. Trucks by Vehicle Configuration 

Vehicle Configuration Unit Count Percentage 
Single Unit - Two Axles 124 11.0% 
Single Unit - Three Axles or more 157 14.0% 
Single Unit - Axles Unknown 2 0.2% 
Combo Truck - Truck Tractor – Bobtail 29 2.6% 
Combo Truck - Truck Tractor(s) 40 3.6% 
Combo Truck - Tractor pulling Trailer 697 62.1% 
Combo Truck - Tractor pulling Two Trailers 54 4.8% 
Other/Unknown/Missing 20 1.8% 
Total 1123 100.0% 

Trucks in Single-Vehicle Crashes by Critical Reason 

These crashes involved only a single vehicle. In every case that vehicle was a large truck; no 
passenger vehicles were involved in any of these crashes. The critical reason (ACRReason in 
table CrashAssessment, and OVEReason in table Overview) is the immediate reason for the 
critical event, which is the event that made the crash inevitable. 

The numbers in the second column represent the rounded estimates of how often these factors 
would be coded for all 141,200 estimated trucks involved in fatal and injury crashes that occurred 
during the 33-month period of the study. When the program is run, it will provide unrounded 
estimates. The numbers in this table have been rounded to the nearest 1,000 because they are 
National estimates and subject to sampling and nonsampling errors. The percentages in the last 
column are based on the unrounded estimates divided by 141,200 which is the unrounded 
estimate of trucks involved in fatal and injury crashes during the 33 months. 

1) Perform join (i.e. merge) of two tables, CrashAssessment and Crash using the CaseID 
variable. 

2) Select only cases with VehicleCount = 1. 

3) Select only cases with values for RATWeight > 0. Please note: this step is optional. 
Including this step will filter out large trucks which have zero weighting. There were 107 such 
cases, which were surveyed as part of the study but given a weight of zero because they did not 
meet the study criteria for one reason or another. These cases were still included in the study 
dataset, however, as additional qualitative data.

4) For each value of ACRReason compute the sum of the values for RATWeight, i.e. group 
cases by values of ACRReason and take the weighted counts. Calculate percentage by dividing 
the weighted count by total weighted count. 

Results for step 4 are rounded and given in Table 2 below. 

5) Take results of 3) and take weighted counts of cases for each value of ReasonCat. 
Calculate percentage for reason category by dividing its count by the total number of large trucks. 

Results for step 5 are given in Table 3 below.

One Truck/One Passenger Vehicle Crashes, Associated Factors 

One type of crash of particular interest to many investigators is the one truck/one passenger 
vehicle (PV) crash. These include any crash in which the first two vehicles to collide were a large 
truck and a passenger vehicle. This algorithm ignores vehicles involved in follow-on collisions. 
Only the first two vehicles to collide are of interest here. 

This algorithm describes compilation of a table showing the number of large trucks and 
passenger vehicles in one truck/one PV crashes by five associated crash factors, 1) prescription 
drug use, 2) traveling too fast for conditions, 3) braking system problem, 4) driver fatigue, and 5) 
weather. 

Two-vehicle crashes are included in this example only if one vehicle was a large truck, and the 
other a passenger vehicle. One example of a two-vehicle crash not included in this example is a 
two-vehicle crash involving two large trucks. Another example of a two-vehicle crash not included 
in this particular example would be a two-vehicle crash involving a large truck and a motorcycle. 
Additionally, multi-vehicle crashes are included in this example if and only if the first two vehicles 
to collide are a large truck and a passenger vehicle. In such a crash, only those two vehicles are 
included. Other vehicles involved in the pile-up are excluded from this particular example. The 
complexities of this example require that the vehicles to be used in the example be selected in 
two groups. The first group of vehicles are those involved in two-vehicle crashes. They are 
identified in steps 1 - 5. The second group of vehicles are those involved in multi-vehicle crashes. 
They are identified in steps 6 - 32. Step 33 merges these two groups of vehicles. 

The primary tasks involved in compiling this table are, 1) Classification of the vehicles involved in 
each event, 2) Identification of the two vehicles involved in the first collision, 3) Identification of 
one truck/one passenger vehicle crashes, and 4) Identification and summation of the associated 
factors relevant to all vehicles by vehicle type (i.e. truck versus passenger vehicle). 

1) Join (i.e. merge) the GeneralVehicle and Crash data sets. 

2) Select only cases for which VehicleCount = 2, TruckCount = 1, and CarCount = 1. 

3) Classify vehicles as follows: 

a. If 1 <= GVEBodyType <= 22, or 28 <= GVEBodyType <= 48, the vehicle is a Passenger 
Vehicle (PV), 
b. If 60 <= GVEBodyType <= 78 and GVEBodyType <> 65, the vehicle is a Truck, 
c. All other vehicles are classified as Other. 
4) Assign classifications to new variable called VehicleClass. 

5) Save results keeping only CaseID VehicleNumber VehicleClass and RATWeight. 

6) Join (i.e. merge) tables Events and GeneralVehicle by CaseID and VehicleNumber.

7) Classify vehicles as follows: 

a. If 1 <= GVEBodyType <= 22, or 28 <= GVEBodyType <= 48, the vehicle is a Passenger 
Vehicle (PV), 
b. If 60 <= GVEBodyType <= 78 and GVEBodyType <> 65, the vehicle is a Truck, 
c. All other vehicles are classified as Other. 
8) Assign classifications to new variable called FirstVehicleClass. 
9) Rename VehicleNumber to FirstVehicleNumber. 
10) Save results. 
11) Access table Events. 
12) Select only cases for which EVEObjectContacted <> 0 and 
EVEObjectContacted <= 30.
13) Delete variable VehicleNumber. 
14) Rename EVEObjectContacted to VehicleNumber. 
15) Join (i.e. merge) results with table GeneralVehicle by CaseID and VehicleNumber. 
16) Classify vehicles as follows: 


a. If 1 <= GVEBodyType <= 22, or 28 <= GVEBodyType <= 48, the vehicle is a Passenger 
Vehicle (PV), 
b. If 60 <= GVEBodyType <= 78 and GVEBodyType <> 65, the vehicle is a Truck, 
c. All other vehicles are classified as Other. 
17) Assign classifications to new variable called SecondVehicleClass. 
18) Rename VehicleNumber to SecondVehicleNumber. 
19) Save results. 
20) Join (i.e. merge) results of step 10) and step 19) by CaseID and EventSequence. 
21) Select only cases with positive values for both FirstVehicleNumber and 
SecondVehicleNumber. 

22) Filter cases by selecting only the minimum value of EventSequence for each value of 
CaseID. 
23) Join (i.e. merge) results with Crash table. 
24) Select only cases with values for RATWeight > 0. Please note: this step is optional. Including 


this step will filter out large trucks which have zero weighting. There were 107 such cases, which 
were surveyed as part of the study but given a weight of zero because they did not meet the 
study criteria for one reason or another. These cases were still included in the study data set, 
however, as additional qualitative data. 


25) Select only cases for which VehicleCount > 2. 


26) Select only cases in which one vehicle is of type Truck and the other vehicle is of type 
Passenger Vehicle. 
27) Save results.
28) Rename variable FirstVehicleClass to VehicleClass and rename 


FirstVehicleNumber to VehicleNumber. 
29) Save results keeping only CaseID VehicleNumber VehicleClass and RATWeight. 
30) Access results from step 27). 
31) Rename variable SecondVehicleNumber to VehicleNumber and rename variable 


SecondVehicleClass to VehicleClass.

32) Save results keeping only CaseID VehicleNumber VehicleClass and RATWeight. 

33) Concatenate results from steps 5), 29) and 32). 

34) Join (i.e. merge) results with DriverDecisionAggression table by CaseID and 
VehicleNumber. 

35) Create variable TooFast. If Speeding = 1 or Speeding = 2 or Speeding = 3, then set 
TooFast = RATWeight, else set TooFast = 0. 

36) Save Results. 

37) Access DriverDrugs table. Select only cases with DrugType = 1. This table consists of 
one row per drug used by the driver prior to the crash. For some cases there are multiple 
instances of prescription drug use by a driver. Eliminate repeat rows, i.e. there must be at most 
one row with value of DrugType = 1 per driver. 

38) Join (i.e. merge) results with results from step 36) by CaseID and VehicleNumber. 

39) Create variable PrescripDrug. If DrugType = 1, then set PrescripDrug = RATWeight, 
else set PrescripDrug = 0. 

40) Perform join (i.e. merge) of results with FactorAssessment table by CaseID and 
VehicleNumber. 

41) Create variable BrakeFactor. If BrakeFailure = 1 or BrakesOutOfAdjustment = 1 or 
BrakesInoperative = 1 or BrakesSystemDeficiency = 1, then set BrakeFactor = 
RATWeight, else set BrakeFactor = 0. 

42) Create variable WeatherFactor. If WeatherCount >= 1 and WeatherCount <= 6, then 
set WeatherFactor = RATWeight, else set WeatherFactor = 0. 

43) Join (i.e. merge) results with DriverAssessment table by CaseID and VehicleNumber. 

44) Create variable DriverFatigue. If Fatigue = 1, then set DriverFatigue = RATWeight, 
else set DriverFatigue = 0. 

45) Group cases by VehicleClass. The weighted number of large trucks or passenger vehicles 
in one truck/one passenger vehicle crashes that were speeding - or more specifically, traveling 
too fast for conditions - is the sum of the variable TooFast. Similarly, summing PrescripDrug 
yields the number of drivers taking prescription drugs. Summing BrakeFactor yields the 
number of vehicles with faulty brakes. Summing WeatherFactor yields the number of vehicles 
for which inclement weather was a factor (and as expected the number is the same for large 
trucks and passenger vehicles). Summing DriverFatigue yields the number of vehicles driven 
by fatigued drivers. Results are given below. 

46) Note that results are rounded to nearest 1000. Percentages are calculated by dividing the 
weighted count of vehicles per factor, by the total number of each type of vehicle involved in one 
truck/one PV crashes (i.e. 65460.17).

LTCCS Data Sets 
LTCCS data are available to the public in the form of 43 data sets. The data sets are available in 
SAS, Microsoft Excel, or delimited text versions. Ten of them are imported from SAFER 
(FMCSA's Safety and Fitness Electronic Records) and two are imported from MCMIS (Motor 
Carrier Management Information System) data. The rest contain researcher-collected data. 

• The Airbags data set contains all the airbag-related information for each of the vehicles 
involved in the crash. This material is provided as one record per airbag. 
• The Brakes data set contains information about the brake equipment on the vehicles. It is 
broken out by axle, which becomes part of the unique key of this data set. This material is

Crash Type 

Definition: This variable is used in categorizing the collisions of drivers involved in crashes. A 
collision is defined here as the first harmful event in a crash between a vehicle and some object, 
accompanied by property damage or human injury. The object may be another vehicle, a person, 
an animal, a fixed object, the road surface, or the ground. If the first collision is a rollover, the 
impact is with the ground or road surface. The collision may also involve plowing into soft ground, 
if severe deceleration results in damage or injury. A road departure without damage or injury is 
not defined as a collision. This variable encompasses the “Configuration” variable, which is a 
component of this variable. Cases where the crash type is “No Impact” include fire and 
immersion.

Crash Configuration 

Definition: This variable is used in categorizing the collisions of drivers involved in crashes. A 
collision is defined here as the first harmful event in a crash between a vehicle and some object, 
accompanied by property damage or human injury. The object may be another vehicle, a person, 
an animal, a fixed object, the road surface, or the ground. If the first collision is a rollover, the 
impact is with the ground or road surface. The collision may also involve plowing into soft ground, 
if severe deceleration results in damage or injury. A road departure without damage or injury is 
not defined as a collision. This variable is part of the larger variable “Crash Type.” The “Crash 
Type” variable is actually broken down into three components: the crash category, the crash 
configuration, and the accident type. This variable only deals with the configuration of the crash.

Definition: This variable documents whether or not the driver exhibited aggressive behavior in 
terms of exceeding the speed limit by a minimum of 5 MPH (8.05 kmph) and the vehicle’s speed 
has a bearing on subsequent crash events. A degree of caution is required when assigning this 
element. Specifically, to be considered as a valid aggressive driving element, the act of speeding 
should pose some risk to surrounding traffic. If, for example, the driver is speeding in a stream of 
traffic, this act poses a risk to surrounding traffic. On the other hand, a driver who is speeding late 
at night, on a rural highway with no surrounding traffic, does not pose a risk to others and should 
not be considered as driving aggressively. (This variable was originally an attribute choice under 
the variable “Aggressive Driving Behavior.”)

JackknifeAssessments Data Set 

The JackknifeAssessments data set contains the variables CaseID, PSU, PSUStrat, RATWeight, 
and VehicleNumber. CaseID and VehicleNumber uniquely identify each record in this data set 
and should be used to merge the JackknifeAssessments data set with other vehicle level data 
sets. This data set also contains the following variables: 

Source: All variables in this table are determined by Case Reviewer using all available 
information inputs. Primary sources include the scaled schematic, police report, driver interviews, 
witness interviews, and vehicle inspection results. 

Type Of Jackknife Event 

Definition: This variable establishes the type of precrash jackknife event that is experienced by 
the subject vehicle. In general, the type of jackknife event is determined by the unit of the 
articulated combination that begins to rotate first. For example, if the tractor/cab unit is the first 
unit to begin rotating, the event is generally considered a tractor jackknife. If, on the other hand, 
the trailer unit is the first unit to begin rotating, the event is generally considered to be trailer 
swing.

Seat Belt Pretensioners Present 

Definition: This variable identifies whether or not a seat belt pretensioner is present for a 
manual belt. Pretensioners are designed to take up the slack in the seat belt during a crash of 
sufficient deceleration. When the vehicle is involved in a collision of sufficient force, a 
microprocessor causes current to flow through the seat belt deployment loops to the initiator. 
Current passing through the intiator ignites the material in the canister, producing a rapid 
generation of gas. The gas produced from this reaction deploys the seat belt pretensioners and 
shortens the seat belt pretentioner height, which removes all of the slack in the seat belts. The 
seat belt pretensioners will deploy immediately before the frontal initiator (air bag) modules 
deploy.

Definition: This variable establishes the subject vehicle’s pre-critical event movement pattern. 
The pre-event movement pattern is usually described as the point that both precedes the critical 
precrash envelope and that precedes vehicle motions that place the involved vehicle(s) on an 
imminent collision path. 

Source: Determined by the Case Reviewer using all available information inputs. Primary 
sources include the scaled schematic, police report, driver interviews, and witness interviews. It 
should be noted, however, that this may be a subjective decision based on the preponderance of

Critical Reason For The Critical Precrash Event 

Definition: This variable establishes the critical reason for the occurrence of the critical event. 
The critical reason is the immediate reason for this event and is often the last failure in the causal 
chain (i.e. closest in time to the critical precrash event). Although the critical reason is an 
important part of the description of crash events, it is not the cause of the crash nor does it imply 
the assignment of fault. 

Source: Determined by the Case Reviewer using all available information inputs. Primary 
sources include the scaled schematic, police report, driver interviews, witness interviews, and 
vehicle inspection results. It should be noted, however, that this may be a subjective decision 
based on the preponderance of available evidence.

Attempted Avoidance Maneuver 

Definition: Attempted avoidance maneuvers are movements/actions initiated by the subject 
driver, within the crucial crash envelope, in response to a critical precrash event. Attempted 
avoidance maneuvers occur after the driver has realization of an impending danger. This variable 
documents the driver’s actions initiated in response to the realization of impending danger.

Pre-Impact Stability 

Definition: The purpose of this variable is to assess the stability of the vehicle after the critical 
event. The stability of the vehicle prior to an avoidance action is not considered except in the 
following situation: A vehicle that is out of control (e.g. yawing clockwise) prior to an avoidance 
maneuver is coded “Other vehicle loss of control” only if an avoidance action was taken in 
response to an impending danger. Thus, the variable focuses upon this vehicle’s dynamics after 
the critical event.

Crash Configuration 

Definition: This variable is used in categorizing the collisions of drivers involved in crashes. A 
collision is defined here as the first harmful event in a crash between a vehicle and some object, 
accompanied by property damage or human injury. The object may be another vehicle, a person, 
an animal, a fixed object, the road surface, or the ground. If the first collision is a rollover, the 
impact is with the ground or road surface. The collision may also involve plowing into soft ground, 
if severe deceleration results in damage or injury. A road departure without damage or injury is 
not defined as a collision. This variable is part of the larger variable “Crash Type.” The “Crash 
Type” variable is actually broken down into three components: the crash category, the crash 
configuration, and the accident type. This variable only deals with the configuration of the crash. 

Source: Determined by Case Reviewer using all available information inputs. Primary sources

Appendix A: LTCCS Sampling and Analytical Issues 

Sample Design 

The selection of crashes for the LTCCS was accomplished in two stages, using the infrastructure 
of the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) Crashworthiness Data System (CDS). The 
first stage is the selection of geographic areas called primary sampling units (PSUs). The United 
States has been divided into 1,195 PSUs where each PSU is comprised on a large city, a large 
county, or a group of counties. The PSUs are grouped into 12 categories or strata described by 
geographic region (northeast, midwest, south, west) and degree of population (central city, large 
county, and group of counties). PSUs were selected for the sample in 1986 based on probabilities 
proportional to the number of fatal and injury crashes in that PSU in 1983. The more crashes in a 
PSU, the greater the likelihood that PSU would be included in the sample. The four geographic 
regions are: 

Northeast 

New Jersey – Ocean County 
New York – Kings County (Brooklyn) 
New York – Ulster County 
Pennsylvania – Allegheny County (except Pittsburgh) 
Pennsylvania – Montgomery County 
Pennsylvania – Philadelphia 

Midwest 

Illinois – Chicago 
Indiana – Lake County 
Michigan – Genesee County 
Michigan – Muskegon County 
Michigan – Washtenaw County 
Nebraska – Douglas County 

South 

Alabama – Bibb and Tuscaloosa Counties 
Florida – Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood 
Maryland – Charles and Prince George’s Counties 
North Carolina – Wake County 
Tennessee – Knox County 
Texas – Dallas 

West 

Arizona – Gila, Graham, and Greenlee Counties 
Arizona – Yuma and La Paz Counties 
California – Los Angeles 
Colorado – Gilpin and Jefferson Counties 
Washington – King County (except Seattle) 
Washington – Seattle 

In the second stage, researchers were notified of truck crashes within their PSU. To qualify for 
the LTCCS, a crash had to involve a large truck and at least one fatality that could be classified 

LTCCS Analytical User's Manual Appendix A: LTCCS Sampling and Analytical Issues • 509 


as “K,” or at least one injury that could be classified as “A” or “B” on the KABCOU scale defined 
as: 

K = Killed 
A = Incapacitating Injury 
B= Non-Incapacitating Injury 
C= Possible Injury 
O=No Injury 
U = Unknown 


In most PSUs the goal was to research all qualifying crashes. However, due to notification 
difficulties the crashes sampled were in reality a subset of the crashes occurring in the PSU. The 
difference is accounted for in the sampling weights. Also, researchers sometimes responded to 
crashes that didn’t qualify for the nationally representative sample. If such cases were 
researched, they remain in the LTCCS files for anecdotal analysis with weights of zero (see 
Sampling Weights). 

Sampling Weights 

Each LTCCS case has a value in the variable RATWEIGHT (“Ratio Weight”). This variable gives 
the statistical sampling weight of the case for national representation. RATWEIGHT should be 
used as the weighting variable in all statistical analyses. 

The LTCCS case weights sum to NHTSA’s NASS General Estimates System (GES) estimate of 
in-transport large truck crashes of maximum injury severity K, A or B nationwide from April 1, 
2001 to December 31, 2003 inclusive. The GES was used because it covers all types of crashes 
regardless of vehicle type. The CDS focuses only on those crashes in which at least one 
passenger vehicle was towed due to damage. 

In each PSU, within-PSU weights were derived as the ratio of qualifying GES cases listed during 
the period of the study to qualifying sampled LTCCS cases in the PSU over the entire period of 
the study. The resulting weights were then multiplied by the CDS PSU weight (the inverse of the 
PSU probability of selection) for the respective CDS PSUs. Use of the GES PSU weights would 
not have been valid as PSU weights because the GES has 60 PSUs whereas the truck study was 
only performed only in the 24 CDS PSUs. 

In a final step, the weights resulting from the above steps were post-stratified to GES national 
estimates by PSU region and researched maximum injury severity (see below). This was 
conducted by applying to the unadjusted weight a ratio equal to the ratio of the GES estimate of 
the number of qualifying crashes to the unadjusted LTCCS estimate of the number of qualifying 
crashes by region and researched severity. The 24 CDS PSUs are evenly distributed among four 
NASS geographic regions of the United States, so that each region contains six PSUs. The post-
stratification was applied to remove biases that could occur toward higher injury levels due to the 
notification process. 

Weighted Injury Severity 

The LTCCS case weights sum by maximum injury severity to the GES estimates by maximum 
injury severity if and only if the following variables are used for maximum severity: 

Crash file CRASHRESSevCode 
General Vehicle File GVERESSevCode 
NonMotorists file ANMRESSevCode 

LTCCS Analytical User's Manual Appendix A: LTCCS Sampling and Analytical Issues • 510 


Explanation 

Each LTCCS case contains two different variables assessing the showing the maximum injury 
severity that was recorded on the PAR for the case. However, the truck cases were weighted to 
the GES estimate of similar cases nationwide. In the GES, coders overrule the PAR severity if 
the PAR narrative disagrees with the PAR severity. Therefore, a similar coding procedure was 
undertaken for the truck cases. Experienced NASS injury coders reviewed each vehicle narrative 
and occupant injury coding for each vehicle in each truck case, and recorded the maximum injury 
level by vehicle. The coders also reviewed all non-motorist injuries. If initial reviews were not in 
agreement, the case was re-examined until consensus was reached. If no information was 
available except the PAR assessment, the PAR assessment was migrated into the researched 
assessment. 

The results of the researched severity assessment were coded into the variables 
GVERESSevCode at the vehicle level and ANMRESSevCode for non-motorists. The crash level 
CRASHRESSevCode was derived from GVERESSevCode and ANMRESSevCode by taking the 
highest researched severity in a crash in either the GeneralVehicle or NonMotorists file. 

Cases of Weight Zero 

Of 1070 truck cases in the files, 963 have weights greater than zero. These 963 are the 
nationally representative sample of in-transport large truck cases with maximum injury severity K, 
A, or B occurring between April 1, 2001 and December 31, 2003. LTCCS cases not belonging to 
that universe of cases have weights of zero. Zero-weight cases have not been removed from the 
truck database so that may be available for clinical analysis and anecdotal data. However, they 
should not be included in analyses for national representation. Note that in any software package 
with a weight statement, using the weighted data will result in omission of any cases with weight 
zero. Zero-weight cases fall into at least one of the following categories: 

Crashes Occurring Before April 1, 2001 

These cases are considered pilot cases and do not occur in every PSU. During this time, 
procedures were being tested and finalized. Seventy-five cases fall into this category. 

Crashes Where Maximum Researched Injury Severity Is Not K, A, Or B 

These cases are not part of the universe represented by the weighted cases. These cases 
include those where the maximum researched injury severity was C (5 cases), O (11 cases), U (1 
case), or where the only non-C/O/U injury was a fatality ruled as occurring prior to the crash 
(three cases). To weight these cases to GES cases of the same maximum injury level would 
change the universe of the weighted LTCCS, and would also be impractical given their very small 
sample sizes. 

Crashes Where The Only Involved Large Truck Was Not In Transport 

Crashes where the only involved large truck was not in transport (for instance parked on 
shoulder) are not part of the universe represented by the weighted cases. Twelve non-pilot 
LTCCS cases fall into this category. Their case ID (variable name CASEID) numbers are: 
207003882, 333006634, 333006859, 806004774, 806005979, 807005027, 808004521, 
811005122, 812004811, 816005021, 817005068 and 821003827. 

Analysis Issues 

Standard Errors 

The LTCCS employed a complex sample design involving stages of sampling. Therefore, 
statistical analyses involving variances or standard errors (or procedures that use them, such as 
hypothesis testing and confidence intervals) should be conducted using a software product that 
can take the sampling stages into account, such as RTI’s Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN). The 
nesting variables to use in such an analysis are PSUSTRATA and PSU. The weight variable is 

LTCCS Analytical User's Manual Appendix A: LTCCS Sampling and Analytical Issues • 511 


RATWEIGHT. Using regular SAS procedures will give standard errors that treat the sample as a 
simple random sample and are likely to be underestimated. 

Time Period 

Due to the small sample size, it is strongly recommended that the truck sample be used as a 
whole rather than broken down into years, months, weeks, days of the week or time of day. 
Estimates or trends based on years, months, weeks, days of the week or time of day will not be 
valid. 

Injury Severity 

Weighted and unweighted counts for maximum injury severity as measured by PAR vs. 
researched assessment will not necessarily match. The researched severity assessments – 
CRASHRESSevCode, GVERESSevCode and ANMRESSevCode - should be used for any 
weighted analysis involving severity. The PAR severity variables (CrashPARSevCode, 
GVEPARSevCode, ANMPARSevCode) should not be used for weighted analyses involving 
severity.
