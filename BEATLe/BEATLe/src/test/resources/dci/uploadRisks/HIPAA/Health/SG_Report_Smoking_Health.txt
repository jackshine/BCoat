HOW TO USE THIS INDEX

  The Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health consists of 23
chapters and an Appendix. Each includes a detailed table of contents to lead
the reader to the information sought and to give a quick overview of content.

  The index reflects the contents of all 23 chapters and the Appendix. It
was attempted to use the natural language of the Report whenever possible,
but to achieve consistency in the terminology. some concepts had to be
reworded.

  Major concepts are expressed in primary terms (in bold. all upper case
letters), which are modified by the secondary terms (indented, lower case.
followed by page numbers), in order to convey the specific topic. In order to
lead the reader to primary terms related to the one of interest. cross
references follow many primary terms, e.g.

ALLERGY
(See ulso ALLERGY, TOBACCO:
HYPERSENSITIVITY)

  If a certain concept could have appeared as more than one primary
term, the reader is referred to the primary term actually used in the following
manner:

Areca nut

See BETEL NUT

  Secondary terms are followed by the pagination. The latter consists of
one bold figure, referring to the Report chapter, a colon, followed by the page
number(s). The following examples illustrate this:
