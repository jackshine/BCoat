<HEADLINE> FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo asthma drug wi
ns US approval </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By DANIEL GREEN </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glax
o has belatedly won US approval for one of its most important products
of th
e 1990s, the inhaled asthma treatment Serevent.
The US Food and Drug Adminis
tration had been expected to approve the drug in
December and Glaxo shares f
ell when this did not happen.
After Serevent's approval yesterday, the share
s rose 15p to end the day with
a net fall of 2p at 664p.
The drug is importa
nt to Glaxo because it is a successor to Ventolin, the
long standing big sel
ler in asthma treatment. Such respiratory treatments
are second in importanc
e only to ulcer drugs in Glaxo's therapeutic
portfolio, accounting for almos
t one quarter of total sales.
The older drug has now lost much of its patent
 protection and the company is
relying on Serevent to underpin its position 
in the market.
The drug was approved in Europe in 1991 and should eventually
 reach sales of
Pounds 350m a year, according to James Capel, the broker. In
 the last full
year, Serevent sold Pounds 73m while Ventolin sales were wort
h Pounds 484m.
The drug had a setback last month, however, when Italian gove
rnment
healthcare reforms favoured Ventolin by excluding Serevent from a lis
t of
drugs the government would pay for. Glaxo lodged an appeal against the

ruling.

<HEADLINE> FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo asthma drug wi
ns US approval </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By DANIEL GREEN </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glax
o has belatedly won US approval for one of its most important products
of th
e 1990s, the inhaled asthma treatment Serevent.
The US Food and Drug Adminis
tration had been expected to approve the drug in
December and Glaxo shares f
ell when this did not happen.
After Serevent's approval yesterday, the share
s rose 15p to end the day with
a net fall of 2p at 664p.
The drug is importa
nt to Glaxo because it is a successor to Ventolin, the
long standing big sel
ler in asthma treatment. Such respiratory treatments
are second in importanc
e only to ulcer drugs in Glaxo's therapeutic
portfolio, accounting for almos
t one quarter of total sales.
The older drug has now lost much of its patent
 protection and the company is
relying on Serevent to underpin its position 
in the market.
The drug was approved in Europe in 1991 and should eventually
 reach sales of
Pounds 350m a year, according to James Capel, the broker. In
 the last full
year, Serevent sold Pounds 73m while Ventolin sales were wort
h Pounds 484m.
The drug had a setback last month, however, when Italian gove
rnment
healthcare reforms favoured Ventolin by excluding Serevent from a lis
t of
drugs the government would pay for. Glaxo lodged an appeal against the

ruling.

TO CALM anxious grain traders the Chicago Board 
of Trade will offer a
seminar later this month on El Nino, the weather pheno
menon that develops in
the equatorial Pacific every three to five years and 
can cause global
climate upsets. Grain traders are keen to know if they can 
expect this
year's El Nino to disturb the US weather pattern sufficiently to
 make a dent
in crop output.
Although signs of El Nino had been accumulating
 during 1991, only last month
did the the US National Weather Service finall
y conclude publicly that the
phenomenon was a fact.
The symptoms had been sh
owing themselves overseas since last spring - rising
surface temperatures in
 the eastern and central Pacific, drought in the
western Pacific rim from Au
stralia through Indonesia, a weaker Indian
monsoon, dryness in north-eastern
 Brazil, drought in South Africa and
wetness last summer in the Great Basin 
of the US, which runs from Arizona
north to Idaho.
While many of these condi
tions indicate that El Nino is occurring, they do
not reveal its severity. T
he phenomenon generally peaks in the northern
hemisphere's winter. This help
s explain why Peruvian fishermen dubbed the
phenomenon El Nino, which means 
Christ child in Spanish. It arrived about
Christmas time.
Mr Vernon Kousky, 
a research meteorologist with the US weather service, now
assesses the curre
nt El Nino as 'moderate to strong'. While individual
weather events cannot a
lways be directly attributed to El Nino, some signals
are indicative of its 
strength. Warm water in the Pacific is pushing
moisture into the south-weste
rn US, causing, for example, this winter's
floods in Texas, according to Mr 
Art Douglas, chairman of the Creighton
University's Atmospheric Sciences Dep
artment. Along the Gulf of Mexico, from
Texas to Florida, some areas have al
ready had 200 per cent to 1,000 per cent
of their normal rainfall. Temperatu
res in that region are also beginning to
dip below normal. At the same time 
the phenomenon is upsetting the Jet
Stream, keeping extremely cold air far t
o the north and moderating
temperatures in the Midwest.
The Midwest, America
's most important grain area, is seeing temperatures
four or five degrees Fa
hrenheit above normal, said Mr Jon Davis, the
in-house meteorologist for She
arson Lehman's commodities trading arm. The
weather service predicts that mo
re of the same will occur in those regions
until spring and that the usually
 wet north-west is likely to be dryer, as
is the Ohio valley.
But what conce
rns the grain trade more is what, if anything, will happen
during the critic
al planting and growing season for American crops from June
to August.
Unfor
tunately, weather forecasting is not a precise science. Mr Kousky says
that 
El Nino, usually a 12 to 18 month event, has another six to 12 months
to run
. But he points out that there is no consistent relationship between
El Nino
 and the weather pattern beyond the winter-to-spring months.
'Anything can h
appen,' he admits.
Crop Cast, a Maryland-based weather forecasting service t
hat is used by many
US commodity trading houses, says that while El Nino has
 already affected
South American soyabeans, South African maize and Australi
an wheat, it is
hoping to be able to predict potentially damaging crop effec
ts in the US by
looking at the coincidence of the El Nino with two other cli
matological
events, last year's eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Phillippin
es and the
combination of lunar and solar cycles.
These additional factors a
long with El Nino probably mean that a more
extreme weather pattern bleeds o
ver into summer, according to Mr Kevin
Marcus, director of Crop Cast service
s. He says the likelihood of extreme,
hot and dry weather is 100 per cent, b
ut gives only a one in three chance
that this will have a significant impact
 on crops.
The hot, dry weather would have to occur in July or early August 
to reduce
the maize and soyabean crops significantly, that is by more than 1
0 per
cent. But Mr Marcus is uncertain about how the three phenomena will in
teract
since there no established pattern. He is still waiting for more data
 on the
severity of this year's El Nino.
The phenomenon has prompted commodi
ties markets to gyrate in the past. In
1972-73 the El Nino destroyed the Per
uvian fishmeal catch, which then
accounted for some 45 per cent of the world
 trade in protein feed. In
1982-83 it caused a drought in Africa, which help
ed to send cocoa prices up
by nearly 70 per cent over a period of about a ye
ar.

<HEADLINE> FT  16 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru's f
ishmeal industry set for bumper profits - Production survived last year's El
 Nino visitation to reach a fresh record </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By SALLY BO
WEN </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERUVIAN fishmeal industry is gearing up for a bona
nza predicted to last
for the next two to three years. By late 1992, the sar
dine and anchovy that
form the staple raw material for the industry were bac
k in abundance after
being temporarily affected by the appearance of the dre
aded warm current
known as 'El Nino', which last ravaged fishmeal output in 
1983.
Contrary to predictions, however, Peruvian production survived last ye
ar's
milder visitation and a late boost in fish stocks turned 1992 into yet

another record year. Peru topped the world exporters' league with 1.37m
tonn
es, narrowly outstripping Chile's 1.21m tonnes.
'Statistically, the years af
ter a Nino are excellent,' says Mr Espino of
Imarpe, Peru's maritime institu
te, which is charged with husbanding the
resource and recommending periodic 
fishing bans. Mr Espino estimates that
the Peruvian catch could be raised by
 a quarter or a third from the present
6m tonnes a year without detriment to
 the species.
'And if the fishmeal producers started going for jack mackerel
 - at present
only about 80,000 tonnes a year are landed, perhaps 5 per cent
 of total
stocks - then the sky's the limit,' he says.
The main limitation o
n such expansion is fleet capacity. Most Peruvian
fishing boats are small, w
ith no refrigeration and hug the coast. When El
Nino hits, the fish move int
o deeper waters farther out to sea where these
boats cannot follow.
Peruvian
 producers say they have invested more than Dollars 200m in the past
two yea
rs in fleet renovation and plant and equipment modernisation ashore.
The ind
ustry is moving towards production of higher-quality, low
temperature, steam
-dried meal with 'stickwater' plants to maximise protein
recovery. New boats
 with refrigerated holds are under construction in local
yards. But there's 
still plenty of room, and a warm welcome waiting, for new
investment from ab
road.
Representatives from Chile's huge Angelini group have been in Peru rec
ently
on 'feeling-out' visits. And Venezuelan capital has already entered in
 the
form of a new fishmeal joint venture under the name of Palangrera Perua
na.
But the big surprise of 1993 could be the arrival of the Chinese. Pesca

Peru, the state-owned fishmeal and fishoil giant that produces around 40 per

cent of all national output, is high on this year's privatisation list.
Coo
pers and Lybrand, with financing from the Canadian development agency and
th
e World Bank, is currently completing a valuation and will recommend on
sale
 procedures.
Essentially, the choice is between splitting the company into i
ts 20 plants
and four refineries to sell off individually; or selling the wh
ole company
as one unit.
The only likely buyers on the latter basis would be
 the Chinese - 'and it's
a possibility that has the private producers in a s
tate of panic', says Mr
Eric Topf, head of the Pesca Peru privatisation comm
ittee.
Unofficially, senior Pesca Peru officials say the company should fetc
h 'at
least Dollars 200m', a ball-park figure considered over-optimistic by

private producers.
The state-owned plants are, by and large, elderly and out
dated - though
several are excellently located on the now-desirable extreme 
southern coast
and have their own quays. Drastic personnel reductions during
 1992 put Pesca
Peru back into profit after years in the red, underlining ju
st how
profitable producing fishmeal can be, even from scrap-yard plants.
Ch
ina has established itself as far and away Peru's largest customer, buying
l
ast year almost 60 per cent of all output. Peruvian fishmeal goes to feed
th
e Pacific prawn, turbot and eel which China is successfully exporting in
qua
ntity to the US and Japan.
The Chinese are said to be producing at present s
ome 32m tonnes of animal
foodstuffs a year, in which they use 2 per cent fis
hmeal - a very low
percentage compared with most competitors. A high-level P
eruvian delegation
is now in China 'to try to convince them of the bounties 
of boosting that
fishmeal component,' says Mr Salomon Manzur, Peruvian presi
dent of the
Fishmeal Exporters' Association.
If the Chinese do increase the 
percentage of fishmeal in their current
animal feedstuff production, Peruvia
n producers will be assured of sales for
their expanded fishmeal output for 
several years to come.

<HEADLINE> FT  16 NOV 94 / Law of the Sea promises many disputes 
</HEADLINE>

<
TEXT>
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which enters full
 force
today, seems likely to be treated by coastal states as a rich source 
of
legal and rhetorical arguments to be used against rivals.
This is in spit
e of the fact that the last thing the law's drafters wanted
was to provide d
isputatious countries with extra torpedoes. One of the law's
ostensible purp
oses is to encourage compromises over the exploitation of
maritime resources
, even among countries with unresolved disputes.
Apart from a standoff in th
e Aegean - where Turkey has threatened war if
Greece extends its territorial
 waters to 12 miles - one of the most grave
maritime disputes involves China
 and Vietnam, locked in a war of words over
oil rights in the South China Se
a.
Both China and Vietnam claim to be acting in accordance with the Law of t
he
Sea but their interpretations of the document are miles apart.
Over the l
ast month, China has accused Vietnam of infringing its interests
in internat
ional waters by inviting US and European companies to explore for
oil in the
 Tonkin Gulf.
Vietnam has retorted that it is exercising its legitimate righ
ts in the
economic zone to which it is entitled by the UN convention. It sai
d that
under the terms of that treaty, there were no international waters in
 the
Gulf.
This dialogue of the deaf reflects confusion over the difference 
between
territorial waters - which may be extended, under the UN Law, up to 
12 miles
 -and the 'economic zone' which coastal states are entitled to clai
m,
amounting to either 200 miles or the full extent of their continental she
lf,
whichever is larger.
China and Vietnam are also arguing over resources a
round the Spratly
Islands, a group of reefs and atolls whose other would-be 
owners are Taiwan,
Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines.
China has awarded a
n exploration contract to the US company Crestone for an
area south-west of 
the Spratlys, while Vietnam has awarded a consortium led
by Mobil a bloc sli
ghtly further to the west. Each state has denounced the
other's contract.
So
vereignty over the Spratlys - and hence control of the surrounding
economic 
zone - is crucial to each side's claim to energy rights, and the
salience of
 this issue is expected to grow as the UN convention enters
force.
However a
 study by a London-based law firm, maintains that the law favours
pragmatic 
joint exploitation accords, even among countries with unresolved
disputes.*

Laying out the common-sense arguments for such accords, it notes that oil
de
posits which straddle two states' economic zones cannot be exploited by
one 
without damaging the other's interests. When one state drills, oil from
the 
rival state's zone is liable to flow across the boundary line as a
result.
A
rticle 83 of the UN convention says that pending final agreement on zones,
c
ountries should 'make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements
of
 a practical nature'.
As an example of such a deal, the study cites the 1989
 accord between
Australia and Indonesia over waters south of Timor.
However,
 such accords are not a panacea. Portugal - still seen by the UN as
legal ad
ministrator of East Timor - has challenged Australia's right to
enter the ac
cord, before the International Court of Justice.
The entry into force of the
 UN Law comes a year after its ratification by
the minimum of 60 states. Ano
ther breakthrough came this summer when
provisions on deep-sea mining - outs
ide the zones of any country - were
amended so as to convince the US, the UK
 and Germany to sign.

vereignty over the Spratlys - and hence control of the surrounding
economic 
zone - is crucial to each side's claim to energy rights, and the
salience of
 this issue is expected to grow as the UN convention enters
force.
However a
 study by a London-based law firm, maintains that the law favours
pragmatic 
joint exploitation accords, even among countries with unresolved
disputes.*

Laying out the common-sense arguments for such accords, it notes that oil
de
posits which straddle two states' economic zones cannot be exploited by
one 
without damaging the other's interests. When one state drills, oil from
the 
rival state's zone is liable to flow across the boundary line as a
result.
A
rticle 83 of the UN convention says that pending final agreement on zones,
c
ountries should 'make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements
of
 a practical nature'.
As an example of such a deal, the study cites the 1989
 accord between
Australia and Indonesia over waters south of Timor.
However,
 such accords are not a panacea. Portugal - still seen by the UN as
legal ad
ministrator of East Timor - has challenged Australia's right to
enter the ac
cord, before the International Court of Justice.
The entry into force of the
 UN Law comes a year after its ratification by
the minimum of 60 states. Ano
ther breakthrough came this summer when
provisions on deep-sea mining - outs
ide the zones of any country - were
amended so as to convince the US, the UK
 and Germany to sign.

<TEXT>
Fishing nations are being urged to sink their difference
s and agree an
international treaty governing catches on the high seas in an
 attempt to
halt serious over-fishing.
Over the next two weeks, a United Nat
ions conference in New York will seek
common ground between coastal states, 
whose territorial waters contain 80
per cent of the world's fish, and distan
t-water fishing nations such as
Japan, Spain and Russia, which have large fl
eets operating on the high seas.
Tensions between these two groups have rise
n as stocks of valuable species
such as cod have dwindled.
The UN Food and A
griculture Organisation says the global fishing fleet
increased at twice the
 rate of the world marine catch between 1970 and 1990,
compounded by governm
ent subsidies worth some Dollars 54bn a year to fishing
fleets.
Stock losses
 have led some countries to halt or reduce fishing effort -
Iceland has cut 
back domestic fishing by 50 per cent.
The problem is exacerbated by unregula
ted fishing fleets flying flags of
convenience and subject to no country's r
ules.
Canada, one of the coastal states most concerned about the impact of h
igh
seas fishing on the catch in its territorial waters, seized a foreign
fi
shing vessel outside its waters last April, saying the crew were 'modern
day
 pirates stealing Canada's cod and keeping 30,000 Canadian fishers out of
wo
rk'.
There is not yet any overall international regulation of the world's hi
gh
seas fisheries - those beyond coastal states' 200-mile exclusive economic

zones - although multinational agreements exist in certain regions. The
Nor
th West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, for example, is supposed to
cover h
igh seas stocks off Canada.
The UN conference was initiated by the Rio Earth
 Summit in 1992 and started
work last year to try to close these gaps in the
 1982 UN Convention on the
Law of the Sea.
This month's meeting is scheduled
 to be the final session.
Fish do not obey artificial geographical limits an
d the 'highly migratory
and straddling' stocks covered by the conference are
 those species found
within two or more states' territorial waters or the ad
jacent high seas.
Cod off eastern Canada and pollack in the Bering Sea, for 
example, straddle
several countries' waters, while species such as tuna and 
swordfish migrate
over huge distances. Coastal states want a dominant role i
n regulating
fishing for these species, whereas the long-distance fishing na
tions are
seeking international regulation.
Mr Satya Nandan, the Fijian chai
rman of the conference, has drawn up
principles for a treaty, including prov
ision for enforcement, compulsory and
binding settlement of disputes, and ac
ceptance of scientific evidence on the
state of fish stocks as the basis of 
the agreement.
Some participating nations believe conflicting interests make
 agreement on
an all-embracing treaty unlikely. They suggest, however, that 
one important
loophole - Panama's issue of flags of convenience - may be clo
sed if a
convention can be drawn up stating that countries may issue flags a
nd
fishing rights only for their own territorial waters.
'It appears Panama 
would agree to co-operate,' said an official from a
European Union member st
ate. In exchange, Panama would be offered tariff
concessions on fish exports
 to the EU.

TEXT>
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which enters full
 force
today, seems likely to be treated by coastal states as a rich source 
of
legal and rhetorical arguments to be used against rivals.
This is in spit
e of the fact that the last thing the law's drafters wanted
was to provide d
isputatious countries with extra torpedoes. One of the law's
ostensible purp
oses is to encourage compromises over the exploitation of
maritime resources
, even among countries with unresolved disputes.
Apart from a standoff in th
e Aegean - where Turkey has threatened war if
Greece extends its territorial
 waters to 12 miles - one of the most grave
maritime disputes involves China
 and Vietnam, locked in a war of words over
oil rights in the South China Se
a.
Both China and Vietnam claim to be acting in accordance with the Law of t
he
Sea but their interpretations of the document are miles apart.
Over the l
ast month, China has accused Vietnam of infringing its interests
in internat
ional waters by inviting US and European companies to explore for
oil in the
 Tonkin Gulf.
Vietnam has retorted that it is exercising its legitimate righ
ts in the
economic zone to which it is entitled by the UN convention. It sai
d that
under the terms of that treaty, there were no international waters in
 the
Gulf.
This dialogue of the deaf reflects confusion over the difference 
between
territorial waters - which may be extended, under the UN Law, up to 
12 miles
 -and the 'economic zone' which coastal states are entitled to clai
m,
amounting to either 200 miles or the full extent of their continental she
lf,
whichever is larger.
China and Vietnam are also arguing over resources a
round the Spratly
Islands, a group of reefs and atolls whose other would-be 
owners are Taiwan,
Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines.
China has awarded a
n exploration contract to the US company Crestone for an
area south-west of 
the Spratlys, while Vietnam has awarded a consortium led
by Mobil a bloc sli
ghtly further to the west. Each state has denounced the
other's contract.
So
vereignty over the Spratlys - and hence control of the surrounding
economic 
zone - is crucial to each side's claim to energy rights, and the
salience of
 this issue is expected to grow as the UN convention enters
force.

<HEADLINE> FT  30 AUG 94 / Fleets fight in over-fished waters: Fi
shing disputes have risen up the diplomatic agenda. FT reporters examine the
 conflicts worldwide </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By BRONWEN MADDOX </BYLINE>

TELINE>    NEW YORK </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ten Taiwanese fishing vessels impound
ed by Indonesia, British fishing nets
slashed in the Bay of Biscay, Japanese
 fishermen shot at by a Russian
gunboat, and an Icelandic trawler and Norweg
ian coastguard vessel exchanging
fire - in the past month, fish have been pr
ompting diplomatic incidents and
this shows no sign of ending soon.
Fears ar
e growing that over-fishing is depleting even the most abundant
species, whi
le governments have so far failed to agree on ways to halt
disputes. Canada,
 which has suffered some of the sharpest recent declines in
its fish stocks,
 told a United Nations conference this month in New York
that the oceans wer
e 'in crisis'. However the conference, attended by more
than 90 governments,
 ended on Friday night without consensus on how to
conserve the seas' resour
ces.
Nearly 30 separate conflicts have flared in the past year over rights t
o
fishing. The catalyst for the disputes is that the amounts of fish caught

appear to be declining in the past few years, following four decades of
expl
osive expansion.
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, catc
hes have risen
more than fourfold from 1950 to a peak of more than 90m tonne
s in 1989. But
although precise figures are hard to establish, there are sig
ns that
worldwide catch levels have since dropped by several per cent.
That 
halting of the industry's expansion, many fear, reflects the growing
scarcit
y of many types of fish. Environmental groups paint a vision of the
oceans i
n the next century as a desert. Western countries may see staples of
the kit
chen cupboard such as tuna become expensive delicacies, they warn.
Asian and
 African governments are also becoming alarmed: fish accounts for
between a 
fifth and a third of the animal-derived protein in their
countries' diets, U
N figures suggest, compared to only several per cent of
those in Western cou
ntries.
Scarcity of some species has forced fishermen and consumers to turn 
to new
types of fish. According to Greenpeace, while catch levels rose by a 
third
during the 1980s, almost all of that rise came from just five species:

Alaskan pollack, Chilean jack mackerel, Peruvian anchovies, and Japanese an
d
South American pilchards.
The huge increase in the catch of fish since the
 1950s has been driven
partly by new technology. Fishing fleets home in on s
chools of fish using
sonar and radar. Winches and motors to haul drift nets,
 which can contain
more than 40,000 pounds of fish, have become more powerfu
l, while nets have
become longer, with the inclusion of nylon fibres which r
educe tearing. Nets
now frequently have mouths tens of metres wide, and can 
stretch for hundreds
of metres.
But environmentalists also attribute some of
 the increase in catch levels to
the changes in international fishing regula
tions more than a decade ago. The
1982 Law of the Sea pushed the boundaries 
of national waters outwards from
12 miles offshore to 200 miles.
The new rul
es, which brought more than three quarters of the world's fish
within nation
al waters, was followed by a doubling of the size of the
world's fishing fle
ets, according to the UNFAO. Overcapacity - the total
number of vessels is e
stimated at some three million - has pushed many parts
of the industry into 
loss. According to the UNFAO, fishing fleets spent some
Dollars 92bn in 1989
. Revenue figures are hard to establish with precision,
but UN figures and i
ndustry analysts suggest that they amounted only to some
Dollars 70bn.
Much 
of the shortfall is plugged by billions of pounds in government
subsidies. E
uropean Union countries alone spend nearly Dollars 600m a year,
according to
 UN estimates. Countries fear that if they surrender national
fishing rights
 they could lose tens of thousands of jobs. There is no
shortage of examples
 to fuel their anxiety. At least 20,000 people working
in the traditional co
d fisheries of Newfoundland have been put out of work
since the Canadian gov
ernment banned fishing in 1992 in an attempt to boost
depleted stocks. The g
overnment has since paid more than CDollars 1bn
(Pounds 400m) to support the
se communities.
The bitterest international rows in the past year have focus
ed on
'migrating' fish such as tuna and swordfish which travel thousands of

kilometres through the high seas to feed and spawn. The past year's disputes

have also including rights to 'straddling' fish such as cod, herring and
so
me types of squid, which migrate between coastal and international waters.
M
r Satya Nandan, Fiji ambassador to the UN and chairman of the conference,
sa
id last week that the required backing of two-thirds of the delegates
should
 be achievable as 'the overwhelming majority want a binding solution'.
Gover
nments meet again in six months time. If the frequency of conflicts
stays at
 its present level, they will have every incentive to overcome those
differe
nces.

<TEXT>
INTERIOR ministers from east and west Europe g
athering in Budapest yesterday
for a conference on migration were immediatel
y pressed by Germany to help
curb the influx of illegal immigrants.
Germany 
is urging east European countries to take back nationals resident
elsewhere 
without permission, and speed migrants' return to their country of
origin. A
lso high on the agenda is a proposal to co-ordinate action on
international 
'human smuggling' groups.
The Germans want 'non-front-line' western countrie
s to share the burden of
financial aid towards strengthening eastern Europe'
s immigration controls.
The conference coincides with German efforts to tigh
ten the country's
liberal asylum rules.
Germany's proposed constitutional am
endment would allow authorities to turn
back claimants for refugee status if
 they arrive from 'safe' neighbouring
east European countries. Poland and th
e Czech Republic are determined not to
become a cordon sanitaire for seekers
 of asylum in Germany.
Bonn's efforts have an added urgency because of conti
nuing racist attacks
against foreigners. But EC countries less affected by i
mmigration from
eastern Europe are grudging in their solidarity. UK official
s said yesterday
that, while backing recommendations on exchange of informat
ion, they did not
wish to see new measures, describing as unrealistic ideas 
about financial
aid.

<HEADLINE> FT  07 JUN 93 / Eight die as freighter runs aground </
HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By NIKKI TAIT </BYLINE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK </DATEL
INE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST eight people died early yesterday morning after a freig
hter,
believed to be carrying hundreds of illegal Chinese immigrants, ran ag
round
close to Rockaway beaches in the Queens borough of New York City.
The 
grounding of the freighter, the Golden Venture, happened shortly after
2am y
esterday. More than 100 Chinese passengers plunged into the chilly
waters, a
nd swam about half a mile to the shore.
According to emergency rescue worker
s, who reached the scene shortly
afterwards, four passengers were known to h
ave died on the beach, and
another two in hospital later. Two bodies were al
so washed ashore.
By late afternoon officials said that they had accounted f
or about 300
people. Many of those who swam ashore were said to be suffering
 from
exposure or hypothermia, and about 20 had been taken to hospital. Ther
e were
also growing fears that tuberculosis may have been prevalent on the v
essel.
Initial pictures released by the US Coast Guard of the freighter's in
terior
suggested that conditions had been extremely cramped and squalid. How
ever,
officials still lacked a firm indication of the number of people who h
ad
been aboard the ship.
Interpreters who were called to the scene said that
 some passengers claimed
to have been aboard the freighter for more than 100
 days. They also reported
that it made a number of stops in China before cro
ssing the ocean. This
fuelled rumours that the ship was operated by an Asian
 'human smuggling'
ring, which had charged passengers Dollars 20,000-Dollars
 30,000 for the
journey.
Mr William Slattery, New York district director for
 immigration and
naturalisation, said the immigrants were mostly Chinese fro

AT LEAST eight people died early yesterday morning after a freig
hter,
believed to be carrying hundreds of illegal Chinese immigrants, ran ag
round
close to Rockaway beaches in the Queens borough of New York City.
The 
grounding of the freighter, the Golden Venture, happened shortly after
2am y
esterday. More than 100 Chinese passengers plunged into the chilly
waters, a
nd swam about half a mile to the shore.
According to emergency rescue worker
s, who reached the scene shortly
afterwards, four passengers were known to h
ave died on the beach, and
another two in hospital later. Two bodies were al
so washed ashore.
By late afternoon officials said that they had accounted f
or about 300
people. Many of those who swam ashore were said to be suffering
 from
exposure or hypothermia, and about 20 had been taken to hospital. Ther
e were
also growing fears that tuberculosis may have been prevalent on the v
essel.
Initial pictures released by the US Coast Guard of the freighter's in
terior
suggested that conditions had been extremely cramped and squalid. How
ever,
officials still lacked a firm indication of the number of people who h
ad
been aboard the ship.
Interpreters who were called to the scene said that
 some passengers claimed
to have been aboard the freighter for more than 100
 days. They also reported
that it made a number of stops in China before cro
ssing the ocean. This
fuelled rumours that the ship was operated by an Asian
 'human smuggling'
ring, which had charged passengers Dollars 20,000-Dollars
 30,000 for the
journey.
Mr William Slattery, New York district director for
 immigration and
naturalisation, said the immigrants were mostly Chinese fro
m Fukien
province.
The 11 crew members were still being questioned by the US
 authorities last
night, while their passengers were placed in the custody o
f the US
Immigration and Naturalisation Service. All are understood to have 
asked for
political asylum.
The vessel itself remained stranded on a sand-ba
nk. However, the local Coast
Guard reported that it was up against a 'rock j
etty', and expressed concern
that an oil spill might develop. The ship was c
arrying about five tons of
diesel fuel.
Illegal Chinese immigration has been
 on the rise in New York City, but this
is believed to be the first time a v

passengers has disgorged its load on t
he city's shoreline.

California's latest immigration problem </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By LOUISE KE
HOE and TONY WALKER </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMMIGRATION officials in California fea
r that thousands of illegal Chinese
emigrants may be on board ships headed f
or the west coast of the US,
following the apprehension of about 500 Chinese
 landing along the coast over
the past two weeks.
Two trawlers, each carryin
g a human cargo of about 150 Chinese immigrants
packed into the holds, were 
seized earlier this week as they landed at
fishing harbours near Monterey an
d San Francisco. The coastal vessels are
believed to have picked up their pa
ssengers five days earlier from off-shore
'mother ships' which crossed the P
acific.
Last month, in an even more brazen attempt to smuggle people into th
e US,
the Pai Sheng, a Chinese freighter, sailed under the Golden Gate Bridg
e
right into San Francisco Bay to drop off about 270 passengers at a disused

city pier. Most were detained after a chase by police and immigration agent
s
through city parks and streets.
These incidents are further evidence of wh
at US authorities say is a
large-scale smuggling operation with suspected li
nks to Asian organised
crime rings in the US and Hong Kong.
The immigrants, 
most of them men in their 20s, pay fees of between Dollars
20,000 (Pounds 13
,000) and Dollars 40,000 for their passage to the US,
according to investiga
tors. They scrape together about Dollars 1,000,
typically borrowed from rela
tives, to board the ships, and are then indebted
for the balance of their 'f
are'.
Most of the illegal immigrants set off from the coastal Chinese provin
ces of
Fujian and Guangdong. Many, however, come from China's hinterland whe
re
people feel they are being left behind by the economic boom in more
prosp
erous areas of the country. A widening economic gap between country and
city
 is contributing to the desperation of many young Chinese.
Although they com
e to the US seeking jobs and economic prosperity, the
immigrants instead bec
ome slaves to their smugglers and many resort to crime
to pay off their debt
s, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
'They are selling their
 souls. What are these people going to do to pay off
the smugglers? ' asks R
ichard Held, a FBI Special Agent in San Francisco.
'Does that mean moving he
roin or cocaine? That is a distinct possibility.'
The recent influx has rais
ed suspicions in the US of complicity by the
Chinese government in the human
 trafficking. But in Beijing officials deny
'turning a blind eye' to illegal
 emigration. 'The Chinese government has all
along been opposed to illegal e
migration and has adopted a series of
measures to stop it,' said Mr Wu Jianm
in, the Chinese foreign ministry
spokesman.
Mr Wu insisted that Chinese secu
rity organisations had 'intensified their
efforts' to stop illegal organisat
ions trafficking in immigrants.
However, some of the immigrants landing in S
an Francisco this week spoke of
paying additional fees to bribe Chinese gove
rnment officials to let them
leave the country, according to US investigator
s.
With millions of dollars being extorted from the passengers of the Chines
e
smuggling ships, it seems unlikely that the practice will end soon. So far

this year, the US Coast Guard has detained over 1,600 illegal Chinese
immig
rants, more than twice the number in 1992.
The rising numbers could, however
, reflect a change of route, rather than a
growing volume of illegal immigra
nts. US investigators speculate that the
smugglers are now cutting out 'midd
le men' in other countries and attempting
to maximise their profits by landi
ng their passengers directly on US shores.
Chinese officials charge that the
 willingness of some countries (including
the US) to grant 'political asylum
' to Chinese emigrants is encouraging
human smuggling.
Indeed, US immigratio
n lawyers representing some of the passengers of the
Pai Sheng say that they
 will seek asylum and note that the judicial process
may take as long as 10 
years, giving their clients time to seek legal US
residency.

most of them men in their 20s, pay fees of between Dollars
20,000 (Pounds 13
,000) and Dollars 40,000 for their passage to the US,
according to investiga
tors. They scrape together about Dollars 1,000,
typically borrowed from rela
tives, to board the ships, and are then indebted
for the balance of their 'f
are'.
Most of the illegal immigrants set off from the coastal Chinese provin
ces of
Fujian and Guangdong. Many, however, come from China's hinterland whe
re
people feel they are being left behind by the economic boom in more
prosp
erous areas of the country. A widening economic gap between country and
city
 is contributing to the desperation of many young Chinese.
Although they com
e to the US seeking jobs and economic prosperity, the
immigrants instead bec
ome slaves to their smugglers and many resort to crime
to pay off their debt
s, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
'They are selling their
 souls. What are these people going to do to pay off
the smugglers? ' asks R
ichard Held, a FBI Special Agent in San Francisco.
'Does that mean moving he
roin or cocaine? That is a distinct possibility.'
The recent influx has rais
ed suspicions in the US of complicity by the
Chinese government in the human
 trafficking. But in Beijing officials deny
'turning a blind eye' to illegal
 emigration. 'The Chinese government has all
along been opposed to illegal e
migration and has adopted a series of
measures to stop it,' said Mr Wu Jianm
in, the Chinese foreign ministry
spokesman.
Mr Wu insisted that Chinese secu
rity organisations had 'intensified their
efforts' to stop illegal organisat
ions trafficking in immigrants.
However, some of the immigrants landing in S
an Francisco this week spoke of
paying additional fees to bribe Chinese gove
rnment officials to let them
leave the country, according to US investigator
s.
With millions of dollars being extorted from the passengers of the Chines
e
smuggling ships, it seems unlikely that the practice will end soon. So far

this year, the US Coast Guard has detained over 1,600 illegal Chinese
immig
rants, more than twice the number in 1992.
The rising numbers could, however
, reflect a change of route, rather than a
growing volume of illegal immigra
nts. US investigators speculate that the
smugglers are now cutting out 'midd
le men' in other countries and attempting
to maximise their profits by landi
ng their passengers directly on US shores.
Chinese officials charge that the
 willingness of some countries (including
the US) to grant 'political asylum
' to Chinese emigrants is encouraging
human smuggling.
Indeed, US immigratio
n lawyers representing some of the passengers of the
Pai Sheng say that they
 will seek asylum and note that the judicial process
may take as long as 10 
years, giving their clients time to seek legal US
residency.

<HEADLINE> FT  16 FEB 93 / Germans call for aid in curbing illega
l migrants </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By NICHOLAS DENTON </BYLINE>
<DATELINE>  
  BUDAPEST </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIOR ministers from east and west Europe g
athering in Budapest yesterday
for a conference on migration were immediatel
y pressed by Germany to help
curb the influx of illegal immigrants.
Germany 
is urging east European countries to take back nationals resident
elsewhere 
without permission, and speed migrants' return to their country of
origin. A
lso high on the agenda is a proposal to co-ordinate action on
international 
'human smuggling' groups.
The Germans want 'non-front-line' western countrie
s to share the burden of
financial aid towards strengthening eastern Europe'
s immigration controls.
The conference coincides with German efforts to tigh
ten the country's
liberal asylum rules.
Germany's proposed constitutional am
endment would allow authorities to turn
back claimants for refugee status if
 they arrive from 'safe' neighbouring
east European countries. Poland and th
e Czech Republic are determined not to
become a cordon sanitaire for seekers
 of asylum in Germany.
Bonn's efforts have an added urgency because of conti
nuing racist attacks
against foreigners. But EC countries less affected by i
mmigration from
eastern Europe are grudging in their solidarity. UK official
s said yesterday
that, while backing recommendations on exchange of informat
ion, they did not
wish to see new measures, describing as unrealistic ideas 
about financial
aid.

<HEADLINE> FT  02 JUL 94 / Travel: Myth and reality of the Rio G
rande - Nicholas Woodsworth hangs out on the US-Mexican border </HEADLINE>
<
BYLINE>    By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boca Chica. In my imagina
tion the Rio Grande has always loomed large and
wide, a substantial expressi
on of the frontier and all that is heroically
American. But what is true of 
the country's favourite sweet and sticky
soft-drink is also true of the rive
r - the real thing is never as impressive
as the myth that surrounds it.
Her
e, at its mouth on the Gulf of Mexico, more than 1,500 miles from its
source
, the Rio Grande is no mighty river. Shallow, muddy and sluggish, it
is bare
ly more than 15 yards across. Standing on its crumbling banks, I felt
deceiv
ed. Life on the border is not quite the old west romance you might
think. It
 is, in fact, far more more curious and compelling than that.
On the other s
ide, a line of rusty pick-up trucks was parked on the beach
and a dozen cowb
oy-hatted Mexicans were spending a sunny Saturday morning
fishing. Seagulls 
screamed overhead and excited Latin rhythms floated on the
mild winter air f
rom truck radios.
On the beach, one of the Mexicans threw a metal grill over
 a fire of broken
fruit crates. Another, all whiskers and paunch, stripped t
o his bright green
boxer shorts. Wading gingerly into the river, he began ca
sting a circular
throw-net for the whiting that come to the river's mouth at
 low tide.
His casting was interrupted by the approach of a small motor boat
 from
up-river. It cut cross-stream and nosed into the Mexican shore. A woma
n
climbed out of one of the trucks, hopped into the boat, and in 30 seconds

was ferried to the American side. Jumping into a waiting vehicle, she
disapp
eared down the flat sand beach towards the main road and the city of
Brownsv
ille, half-an-hour away.
'Just one more Dollars 50-a-week cleaning lady,' sa
id Jesse, the young
Chicano I had been chatting to, as he cast a baited hook
 into the stream.
'No work papers, no resident's card, no minimum wage.'
Jes
se has no such worries. Hispanic by blood but American by birth, he is of
tw
o minds about the country across the river. He is a product of la
frontera, 
and tied to the strongly-flavoured, hybrid border culture that has
grown up 
along the Rio Grande. He is as 'Tex-Mex' as tacos and enchiladas,
or as Radi
o Caliente, the local station which serves rapid-fire bilingual
chit-chat an
d conjunto, the Anglo-Hispanic accordion music of the border.
But Mexico its
elf appeals little: Jesse knows that if Mexicans are willing
to take up expl
oited, illegal lives in the US for Dollars 50 a week, it is
because life at 
home is harder still.
Did he himself often cross the border to Matamoros, I 
asked? 'Not much.
Liquor is cheaper there. But there's too much hustling - s
tolen cars,
hookers, drugs, phoney documents, smuggling, scams of all kinds.
 There are
some real bad guys over there. Last time they took my money.'
Who
 were 'they', I asked. Street toughs? No, he said, laughing. The police.
For
 most, life on the border is rarely fair or easy.
Matamoros. An air of shabb
iness, poverty, and impermanence hangs over the
Rio Grande, especially here 
in the seamy bars and billiard halls, the dog
tracks and strip joints, the p
awn shops and gun stores. On both sides of the
border you will find people a
nd services providing for and exploiting human
need. Americans cross the bor
der in search of exoticism and surreptitious
pleasures. Most Mexicans seem h
appy to find rough survival on the other
side.
Essentially, this is no man's
 land. Trust and familiarity are foreign here -
shop windows are grilled, fe
nces abound, 'No Loitering' signs hang in
parking lots and gas stations. Few
 outsiders linger along the underbelly of
the US. Most feel a strong sense o
f place here, but little sense of
belonging. If the border belongs to anyone
, it is to the anonymous
transients who stream over it.
The international cr
ossing points over the Rio Grande are a travel bargain.
Where else on earth 
can you pay 25 cents and in seconds walk from a society
of high-tech mass-co
nsumption to third world neglect and deprivation? It is
along the Rio Grande
 that the techtonic plates of the north-south divide run
edge to edge.
But i
n spite of the cracked pavements, the cheap blankets and tourist
trinkets, t
he sleazy come-ons to buy marijuana or half-an-hour with a young
girl, there
 is something refreshing about Mexican towns on the Rio Grande.
They have a 
heart.
On the US side, community life has largely disappeared from downtown

pavements. If it exists anywhere, it is in freeway shopping malls and fast
f
ood places out on the urban peripheries - there are times when America's
sou
l seems approachable only by car.
Mexican life, though, is immediately acces
sible. In Matamoros there were
mobile vendors and shoe-shine boys, blind mus
icians and sellers of lottery
tickets, squeezers of fruit juice and pavement
 grillers of skewered lamb.
There were crowded markets and city squares grac
ed by orange trees and
bandstands of ornate wrought iron work. Whole familie
s promenaded, entire
armies of men chatted the day away. Shopping malls may 
be more efficient,
but I will take the streets of Matamoros any day.
The low
er Rio Grande Valley. I spent a morning in a trailer park with
Barbara and A
rchie Dick. If they make the only decent cup of tea in the
whole valley, it 
is because they have not forgotten their native Glasgow.
They had driven dow
n from the frozen wastes of Ontario, where they now live,
for some winter su
nshine. But was it really worth it, I wondered?
Not long ago the valley's we
alth came largely from the market gardens and
fruit orchards, sugar cane and
 cotton fields worked and harvested by Chicano
and Mexican immigrant labour.
 These days, it is the fast-growing retirement
industry that fills the roads
ide fields the length of the lower valley.
I do not begrudge retired people 
their place in the sun, their health and
leisure centres, their golf carts a
nd woodworking classes, their social
evenings that have turned the valley in
to the square-dancing capital of the
world.
But I did have difficulties with
 their 80,000 'RVs' - recreational vehicles
 -and the more than 500 monstrou
s 'RV parks' that blot the landscape here.
RVs - great blocks of lumbering, 
wheeled real estate that permit the
transfer of ghastly suburbs from one par
t of the country to the other - may
one day take over the US. When I left th
e valley to follow the river up to
Big Bend, I counted a convoy of eight 55-
ft monsters from Quebec pulling out
behind me, a lost tribe seeking its dest
iny in the desert.
Laredo. Saturday night in downtown Laredo, on the US side
 of the border, is
deader than it ever was when this was a dung-spattered fr
ontier town. I
spent the early evening at my motel off Interstate 35 drinkin
g beer with a
crowd of over-nighting truck-drivers. We sat out in the parkin
g lot in front
of a plastic garbage can filled with ice and bottles of Bud, 
and told dirty
jokes. I have long known that truck drivers are the folk hero
es of modern
America. Now I am trying to figure out why.
Nuevo Laredo. Where
 do all the hip cowboys in Laredo head on a Saturday
night? Answer: Nuevo La
redo on the other side of the Rio Grande. Near the
clubs on Plaza San Miguel
, the pavements were jammed and noisy. By midnight
there was car gridlock do
wntown, and the line to get into the OK Tijuana
discotheque stretched round 
the corner.
There were no signs of the usual Rio Grande poverty in the OK Ti
juana, none
of its striking contrasts. Like the Americans in the place, the 
Mexicans
were all young, good-looking, well-dressed and well-off. What is mo
re, the
two groups were hardly distinguishable. The Mexican city has a sizea
ble
middle-class, and its US sister-city a mixed Anglo-Hispanic population.

Big Bend. Nancy Kerrigan, the Bobbitts, California earthquakes, Elvis
Presle
y, the Cowboys vs the Bills - you can twiddle the car radio knob late
at nig
ht and catch all of America's madness as the striped lines fly by, but
in Bi
g Bend country none of it will touch you.
Big Bend - a big bend in the Rio G
rande - is what is left of the unspoilt
frontier. It is a huge, remote, larg
ely uninhabited tract in the Chihuahua
desert, and breathtaking in its beaut
y. For US tourists, who still believe
strongly in the idea of the frontier, 
its national park is a sanctuary
protected from everything but tourism itsel
f.
But even wagon trains of RVs lose themselves in this vast space, and I fo
und
a serene stretch of riverbank. On the other side, the little Mexican vil
lage
of Santa Elena slumbered in the winter sunshine. There were no bridges 
or
border posts or hustlers here, just a rowboat and a ferryman sitting on t
he
far bank beside a burro. The ferryman dozed, the burro dozed, and I, too,

settled quietly to an afternoon of dreaming. Here, at least, the river was

as wide and deep and peaceful as it has always been in my imagination.

<BYLINE>    By AP </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Coast Guard intercepted tw
o boats trying to smuggle 270 Chinese into
California yesterday, coinciding 
with a Chinese government statement that it
had stepped up efforts to halt i
llegal emigration, AP reports.
'The public security departments have stepped
 up efforts to track down the
criminal groups organising human smuggling and
 patrols at sea,' a Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
Since January a
uthorities on both sides of the Pacific have intercepted
boats carrying abou
t 2,500 Chinese, each of whom had paid or promised
smugglers Dollars 20,000-
Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 13,000-Pounds 19,500) to get
them into the US illegal
ly. Many others are entering overland from Mexico or
arriving at airports wi
th false documents.

<TEXT>
I PASSED a b
uilding site recently. There is not much building work in London
at present,
 given that construction is one of the 97,500 UK industries to
have received
 a pitiless booting from John Major, Norman Lamont, and their
masters at the
 Treasury. But this site was active. A man was at work:
probably late 20s, y
obbo-jeaned, forehead invisible, knuckles dangling, the
Sun in his pocket, l
eering at passing women. He was working amid fumes and a
blaze of sparks, do
ing something to a girder. He was drowning in sweat.
I started to feel sorry
 for him, until I remembered that I have stopped
feeling sorry for Sun reade
rs. I was transfixed, instead, by the thought
that there were no imaginable 
circumstances in which I would be capable of
doing what he was doing unless 
forced into it as a prisoner of war. We were
virtually different species. Ou
r paths had diverged.
But it has given me an idea. For those of us who were 
at our desks this week
and not basting ourselves in Fiji, the most cheering 
news was the
proposition by Teresa Gorman, Billericay's Conservative MP, tha
t for every
UK business that went bankrupt from now on, the government shoul
d sack a
civil servant at the Treasury - starting with the permanent secreta
ry.
The Gorman plan won immediate support, in The Times, from macho pundit
A
natole Kaletsky, whose blow-torching of the Treasury and its do-nothing
smug
ness has been one of the summer's highlights for those who read good
newspap
ers.
It must be terrible to be torched by Kaletsky. The Gorman plan, he wrot
e,
should be put into effect immediately, with just one amendment to make it

fair. 'The mandarins should be given until Christmas to produce a clear
eco
nomic recovery. If they failed, the first ritual sacking, of Sir Terence
Bur
ns, the present permanent secretary, would be set for New Year's Day.'
This 
could transform government policy overnight. While Lamont and Major
deserved
 part of the blame for the length and depth of the recession, 'the
greater c
ulprits have been the Treasury officials who have been telling them
how to a
ct, speak and think at each step of the economy's long decline. The
doctrine
 of ministerial responsibility, far from ensuring a democratically
accountab
le government, has long been a shield to hide the incompetence of
the top ci
vil servants who make most of the government's decisions.'
The Gorman-Kalets
ky plan would undoubtedly work, but it would succeed more
speedily with an a
dditional refinement - if the mandarins knew in advance
what fate awaited th
em after January 1. Sacking is not enough. They would
retreat to their Dorse
t or Tuscan properties, spend their time pottering,
swim in lazy pools, sit 
among their roses, read Petronius and Seneca - and
thumb their noses at us f
rom the comfort of retirement.
Instead, they must be punished. If the Britis
h economy is ever to recover,
the mandarins must know what lies in store if 
they fail to gird their loins
and get things moving. They must be put out to
 real work.
We will start with Sir Terence on January 1. We won't just sack 
him. We will
send him to live in Catford, give him a pair of jeans, some siz
e 13 boots,
make him read the Sun, watch Eldorado, ride on public transport,
 work on a
building site, out in all weathers, cope with sparks and fumes, l
earn what a
girder is - a dog's life for Terry. We will see how he likes a t
aste of his
own medicine.
From New Year's Day - I promise - we will hear les
s and less rubbish from
the Treasury ventriloquists and their dummies: no ga
in without pain,
unemployment a price worth paying, vital not to throw the b
aby out,
credibility all important, things safe with us, old man, we know wh
at we're
doing.
That should provide us with a memorable January 1. On Januar
y 2 we will sack
the second highest Treasury mandarin. I do not know his nam
e. That is the
point. Mandarins are furtive, creatures of the shadows, never
 brought to
book. Which is what we would be changing. We would appoint the s
econd
Treasury mandarin to the post of chief council tax collector in the bo
rough
of Brent. January 3: rat-catching in the Chunnel.
January 3 is followe
d by January 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20 an
d so on. Of course it would work. By February we would
be humming; by March,
 in fine heart; by April, ruling Europe.

building site, out in all weathers, cope with sparks and fumes, l
earn what a
girder is - a dog's life for Terry. We will see how he likes a t
aste of his
own medicine.
From New Year's Day - I promise - we will hear les
s and less rubbish from
the Treasury ventriloquists and their dummies: no ga
in without pain,
unemployment a price worth paying, vital not to throw the b
aby out,
credibility all important, things safe with us, old man, we know wh
at we're
doing.
That should provide us with a memorable January 1. On Januar
y 2 we will sack
the second highest Treasury mandarin. I do not know his nam
e. That is the
point. Mandarins are furtive, creatures of the shadows, never
 brought to
book. Which is what we would be changing. We would appoint the s
econd
Treasury mandarin to the post of chief council tax collector in the bo
rough
of Brent. January 3: rat-catching in the Chunnel.
January 3 is followe
d by January 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20 an
d so on. Of course it would work. By February we would
be humming; by March,
 in fine heart; by April, ruling Europe.

<TEXT>
WHEN THE Channel tunnel officially opens next May, the projec
t will be
nearly a year late and its cost of Pounds 8.8bn almost double the 
original
estimate. The construction has been dogged by disputes between Euro
tunnel,
the operator, and TML, the contractor. Eurotunnel shareholders will 
also
have been asked twice to stump up extra cash. The impression of financi
al
disorder in what was billed as a flagship of free enterprise is such that

some observers are asking whether it would not have been better to leave th
e
project to the public sector.
Such a conclusion would be wrong. First, it 
is not clear that Eurotunnel has
been such a bad investment. Much will depen
d on how much traffic it carries,
but the initial shareholders show a modest
 if unexciting gain on their
investment at yesterday's closing price of 488p
. Second, it is almost
certain that the public sector would have done worse 
in keeping costs under
control. It is hard to believe that Department of Tra
nsport civil servants
would have harried the contractors with the same vigou
r as Sir Alastair
Morton, Eurotunnel's abrasive chief executive.
However, le
ssons can be learnt from the Eurotunnel experience. Doing so is
also necessa
ry, given the UK government's intention of attracting private
finance for a 
range of traditionally public sector investments such as
roads, railways, pr
isons and hospitals.
One lesson is that it is worth the government taking a 
bit more time and
spending a bit more money defining projects up-front. With
 the Channel
tunnel, failure to do so meant the operating franchise was awar
ded to a
group of construction companies. When they floated Eurotunnel off, 
it was
already saddled with construction contracts with the original promote
rs - a
structure which has been blamed for many of the subsequent disputes. 
It
would have been better to have started with an operator capable of
negoti
ating its own contracts. But to achieve that, the government would
probably 
have had to prime the pump.
Another lesson is that it may not be efficient t
o transfer all the risk of
infrastructure projects to the private sector, pa
rticularly where the
government itself is the source of uncertainty. In Euro
tunnel's case, the UK
government's sluggishness in building more rail and ro
ad links to the tunnel
and a tightening of safety regulations have all reduc
ed the project's
financial attraction. If the government indemnified private
 contractors for
such political and regulatory risks, it would have an incen
tive to keep them
to the minimum.

<HEADLINE> FT  28 NOV 92 / Property: Sellers get a painful lesson
 - Instead of house prices in Kent getting a boost from the Channel Tunnel, 
they're back to the levels of 1986/87 </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By MICHAEL HAN
SON </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING house prices are a tender subject in Kent, desp
ite the ever-nearer
advent of the Channel tunnel. It had been expected the C
hunnel would boost
prices but this has not happened so far. Indeed, they are
 back to their
pre-boom level of 1986/87, which is roughly half what they we
re only two
years ago. That has been a painful lesson for sellers.
Richard P
age, of Savills in Sevenoaks, cites two examples. Meopham Bank, a
Regency ho
use near Tonbridge offered at Pounds 1.25m in the spring of 1990,
has just b
een sold for Pounds 550,000. Pilgrim House at Trottiscliffe, which
was sold 
in 1987 for Pounds 500,000, was re-sold recently at the same
figure.
Then th
ere is Wardes, a nine-bedroom, Grade I-listed medieval hall/house in
four ac
res in the conservation village of Otham, near Maidstone. It is the
finest o
f several timber-framed houses in Otham and was restored in 1912 by
Sir Loui
s Mallet, the diplomat. There is a mural in the living room of a
stag being 
stalked by a hunter and a panther. It was painted by an
architect, Philip Ti
lden, to represent 'the unsuspecting income tax-payer
assailed on all sides.
'
It now needs further restoration and modernisation. Wardes failed this
sum
mer to attract a buyer for Pounds 450,000 and the house is being offered
by 
tender - closing on December 15 - at a guide price of Pounds 250,000. The
ag
ent is Knight Frank & Rutley at Tunbridge Wells (0892-515-035).
Having sold 
the Grange, a rundown, Grade II-listed 17th century house on the
edge of Gou
dhurst (which just failed to reach its guide price of Pounds
250,000), KF&R'
s Robin Tillett is confident Wardes will find a buyer. 'We
are having consid
erable success in selling rundown properties at formal
tender,' he says. 'Th
is will be the fifth since August. I believe going to
tender concentrates pe
ople's minds, and rundown houses inspire the
imagination.'
Meanwhile, the re
cent sale of another notable property at Otham provides
further evidence of 
the fall in prices. The 15-bedroomed Gore Court House,
set in 20 acres and l
isted grade II, came to market in June 1990 at Pounds
750,000. By the summer
 of 1991, the price had drifted down to Pounds
450,000. Two months ago, the 
property was sold at auction by Cluttons for
Pounds 317,500.
Nearly 18 month
s ago, I reported that the owners of the 428-acre Henden
Manor estate at Ide
 Hill, near Sevenoaks, had dropped the asking price of
their beautiful 16th 
century house from Pounds 4m to Pounds 3m because they
'now have a very real
 desire to sell.' That desire has assumed even more
urgency: the price has b
een reduced to Pounds 2m through Savills
(0732-455-551) and KF&R.
Savills al
so is selling the home of journalist Jean Rook, who died last
year. South Ri
ding, a six-bedroom country house in seven acres south of
Edenbridge is pric
ed at Pounds 325,000. Howard Cundey (0342-833-333) is
joint agent.
'Prices h
ave to be extremely sensible and realistic to achieve a sale,' says
Anthony 
Brooks, director of GA Town & Country at Tunbridge Wells
(0892-542-711). 'Pe
ople don't want to listen when we say that properties are
selling at 1987 pr
ices - or even 1986 prices.'
He cites Sissinghurst Park, a Grade II-listed E
dwardian house in 20 acres of
gardens not far from the better-known gardens 
at Sissinghurst Castle. It was
offered at Pounds 1.2m in April 1991 but now 
can be had for Pounds 650,000.
Brooks has just completed the sale of the six
-bedroom Woodsden Farmhouse in
two acres near Hawkhurst for more than Pounds
 250,000, reduced from its
original Pounds 460,000. Its former barn, now con
verted into a five-bedroom
house, is still for sale at Pounds 230,000, down 
from Pounds 325,000.
Simon Backhouse, of Strutt & Parker's Canterbury office
 (0227-451-123),
explains: 'We have got through the pain barrier of explaini
ng to vendors
that prices are lower.' He is looking for offers around Pounds
 375,000 for
Tonford Manor, a Grade II, 18th century moated house in nearly 
six acres at
Harbledown, near Canterbury; and is seeking Pounds 285,000 for 
the
11-bedroom Colkins, a Grade II Georgian house in almost two acres at
Sel
ling, near Faversham.
'There are a lot of cash buyers about,' says Mary Grie
ves, of the Canterbury
office of Cluttons. Acting jointly with GW Finn & Son
s, it has just
exchanged contracts at around Pounds 350,000 on Jossenblock, 
a Grade II
Georgian house in more than two acres at East Langdon, near Dover
. But Peter
Bell, the Cluttons' partner at Folkestone, is still seeking a bu
yer for his
own Grade II-listed country house: Jacques Court, near Canterbur
y, for which
he has been asking Pounds 550,000.
Those seeking flats might, h
owever, have better prospects - in Folkestone,
at least. Says Bell: 'Until 1
988, we had never been able to obtain corporate
rentals here, but we let 25 
flats at a time in new blocks to Eurotunnel and
Trans-Manche Link for their 
senior managers. There will be a slight glut of
flats when the last people m
ove out in 1994.'

WHEN THE Channel tunnel officially opens next May, the projec
t will be
nearly a year late and its cost of Pounds 8.8bn almost double the 
original
estimate. The construction has been dogged by disputes between Euro
tunnel,
the operator, and TML, the contractor. Eurotunnel shareholders will 
also
have been asked twice to stump up extra cash. The impression of financi
al
disorder in what was billed as a flagship of free enterprise is such that

some observers are asking whether it would not have been better to leave th
e
project to the public sector.
Such a conclusion would be wrong. First, it 
is not clear that Eurotunnel has
been such a bad investment. Much will depen
d on how much traffic it carries,
but the initial shareholders show a modest
 if unexciting gain on their
investment at yesterday's closing price of 488p
. Second, it is almost
certain that the public sector would have done worse 
in keeping costs under
control. It is hard to believe that Department of Tra
nsport civil servants
would have harried the contractors with the same vigou
r as Sir Alastair
Morton, Eurotunnel's abrasive chief executive.
However, le
ssons can be learnt from the Eurotunnel experience. Doing so is
also necessa
ry, given the UK government's intention of attracting private
finance for a 
range of traditionally public sector investments such as
roads, railways, pr
isons and hospitals.
One lesson is that it is worth the government taking a 
bit more time and
spending a bit more money defining projects up-front. With
 the Channel
tunnel, failure to do so meant the operating franchise was awar
ded to a
group of construction companies. When they floated Eurotunnel off, 
it was
already saddled with construction contracts with the original promote
rs - a
structure which has been blamed for many of the subsequent disputes. 
It
would have been better to have started with an operator capable of
negoti
ating its own contracts. But to achieve that, the government would
probably 
have had to prime the pump.
Another lesson is that it may not be efficient t
o transfer all the risk of
infrastructure projects to the private sector, pa
rticularly where the
government itself is the source of uncertainty. In Euro
tunnel's case, the UK
government's sluggishness in building more rail and ro
ad links to the tunnel
and a tightening of safety regulations have all reduc
ed the project's
financial attraction. If the government indemnified private
 contractors for
such political and regulatory risks, it would have an incen
tive to keep them
to the minimum.

<HEADLINE> FT  28 NOV 92 / Property: Sellers get a painful lesson
 - Instead of house prices in Kent getting a boost from the Channel Tunnel, 
they're back to the levels of 1986/87 </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By MICHAEL HAN
SON </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING house prices are a tender subject in Kent, desp
ite the ever-nearer
advent of the Channel tunnel. It had been expected the C
hunnel would boost
prices but this has not happened so far. Indeed, they are
 back to their
pre-boom level of 1986/87, which is roughly half what they we
re only two
years ago. That has been a painful lesson for sellers.
Richard P
age, of Savills in Sevenoaks, cites two examples. Meopham Bank, a
Regency ho
use near Tonbridge offered at Pounds 1.25m in the spring of 1990,
has just b
een sold for Pounds 550,000. Pilgrim House at Trottiscliffe, which
was sold 
in 1987 for Pounds 500,000, was re-sold recently at the same
figure.
Then th
ere is Wardes, a nine-bedroom, Grade I-listed medieval hall/house in
four ac
res in the conservation village of Otham, near Maidstone. It is the
finest o
f several timber-framed houses in Otham and was restored in 1912 by
Sir Loui
s Mallet, the diplomat. There is a mural in the living room of a
stag being 
stalked by a hunter and a panther. It was painted by an
architect, Philip Ti
lden, to represent 'the unsuspecting income tax-payer
assailed on all sides.
'
It now needs further restoration and modernisation. Wardes failed this
sum
mer to attract a buyer for Pounds 450,000 and the house is being offered
by 
tender - closing on December 15 - at a guide price of Pounds 250,000. The
ag
ent is Knight Frank & Rutley at Tunbridge Wells (0892-515-035).
Having sold 
the Grange, a rundown, Grade II-listed 17th century house on the
edge of Gou
dhurst (which just failed to reach its guide price of Pounds
250,000), KF&R'
s Robin Tillett is confident Wardes will find a buyer. 'We
are having consid
erable success in selling rundown properties at formal
tender,' he says. 'Th
is will be the fifth since August. I believe going to
tender concentrates pe
ople's minds, and rundown houses inspire the
imagination.'
Meanwhile, the re
cent sale of another notable property at Otham provides
further evidence of 
the fall in prices. The 15-bedroomed Gore Court House,
set in 20 acres and l
isted grade II, came to market in June 1990 at Pounds
750,000. By the summer
 of 1991, the price had drifted down to Pounds
450,000. Two months ago, the 
property was sold at auction by Cluttons for
Pounds 317,500.
Nearly 18 month
s ago, I reported that the owners of the 428-acre Henden
Manor estate at Ide
 Hill, near Sevenoaks, had dropped the asking price of
their beautiful 16th 
century house from Pounds 4m to Pounds 3m because they
'now have a very real
 desire to sell.' That desire has assumed even more
urgency: the price has b
een reduced to Pounds 2m through Savills
(0732-455-551) and KF&R.
Savills al
so is selling the home of journalist Jean Rook, who died last
year. South Ri
ding, a six-bedroom country house in seven acres south of
Edenbridge is pric
ed at Pounds 325,000. Howard Cundey (0342-833-333) is
joint agent.
'Prices h
ave to be extremely sensible and realistic to achieve a sale,' says
Anthony 
Brooks, director of GA Town & Country at Tunbridge Wells
(0892-542-711). 'Pe
ople don't want to listen when we say that properties are
selling at 1987 pr
ices - or even 1986 prices.'
He cites Sissinghurst Park, a Grade II-listed E
dwardian house in 20 acres of
gardens not far from the better-known gardens 
at Sissinghurst Castle. It was
offered at Pounds 1.2m in April 1991 but now 
can be had for Pounds 650,000.
Brooks has just completed the sale of the six
-bedroom Woodsden Farmhouse in
two acres near Hawkhurst for more than Pounds
 250,000, reduced from its
original Pounds 460,000. Its former barn, now con
verted into a five-bedroom
house, is still for sale at Pounds 230,000, down 
from Pounds 325,000.
Simon Backhouse, of Strutt & Parker's Canterbury office
 (0227-451-123),
explains: 'We have got through the pain barrier of explaini
ng to vendors
that prices are lower.' He is looking for offers around Pounds
 375,000 for
Tonford Manor, a Grade II, 18th century moated house in nearly 
six acres at
Harbledown, near Canterbury; and is seeking Pounds 285,000 for 
the
11-bedroom Colkins, a Grade II Georgian house in almost two acres at
Sel
ling, near Faversham.
'There are a lot of cash buyers about,' says Mary Grie
ves, of the Canterbury
office of Cluttons. Acting jointly with GW Finn & Son
s, it has just
exchanged contracts at around Pounds 350,000 on Jossenblock, 
a Grade II
Georgian house in more than two acres at East Langdon, near Dover
. But Peter
Bell, the Cluttons' partner at Folkestone, is still seeking a bu
yer for his
own Grade II-listed country house: Jacques Court, near Canterbur
y, for which
he has been asking Pounds 550,000.
Those seeking flats might, h
owever, have better prospects - in Folkestone,
at least. Says Bell: 'Until 1
988, we had never been able to obtain corporate
rentals here, but we let 25 
flats at a time in new blocks to Eurotunnel and
Trans-Manche Link for their 
senior managers. There will be a slight glut of
flats when the last people m
ove out in 1994.'

<TEXT>
THE PLANNED high-speed rail link between London and the Channel 
tunnel could
be a showpiece for the UK government's initiative of attracting
 private
capital to public infrastructure projects. It provides an opportuni
ty both
to harness the private sector's skills in project management and to 
remove
at least part of a Pounds 2.6bn-Pounds 3bn project from the public se
ctor's
balance sheet.
But to achieve these benefits, the Treasury will need 
to abandon its purist
line that all the risk of such projects should be born
e by private
investors. Sticking to this line could delay or even kill off t
he project,
as Union Railways, the British Rail subsidiary set up to develop
 the link,
will tell ministers later today.
The essential point is that the 
private sector is not well suited to bear
the political and regulatory risks
 associated with the early stages of large
infrastructure projects. Before c
onstruction on the Chunnel link can
proceed, planning consents must be won, 
public inquiries conducted,
legislation passed and safety standards determin
ed. At each stage, there is
a danger that the project will be delayed and ex
tra costs imposed.
This particular project does not start with a happy histo
ry as far as
private companies are concerned. Several construction groups ha
ve already
spent money making proposals, only to have them rejected largely 
for
political reasons. There is also the overhang from the main Channel tunn
el
project, whose financial attraction has been reduced by a tightening of
s
afety regulations and the delay in building road and rail links.
It is doubt
ful whether private funds could be attracted at this stage and,
even if they
 could, a high risk premium would be required. Far better,
therefore, for th
e public sector to put up the Pounds 200m needed for the
project's next phas
e, tiding it over until political and regulatory
uncertainty is largely out 
of the way. After that, it should be easier to
find a further Pounds 2.5bn-p
lus from private investors. The remaining risks
 -concerning construction co
sts, operating expenses and customer demand -
are the type the private secto
r is best at managing.
Given the current budgetary pressures, it is reasonab
le to ask why the
Chunnel link should have priority over other worthwhile pr
ojects that are
now stalled. Part of the answer is that the link is already 
badly delayed.
Constructing it is important not only to maximise the economi
c benefits of
the Channel tunnel but also to ease congestion for commuter tr
affic in the
south-east.
But the most compelling reason for priming the pump
 is that a success with
Union Railways would give a boost to the government'
s private funding
initiative. It could open the door for private capital to 
flow into roads,
railways and prisons. That, more than almost anything else,
 would ease the
pressure on government finances.

THE PLANNED high-speed rail link between London and the Channel 
tunnel could
be a showpiece for the UK government's initiative of attracting
 private
capital to public infrastructure projects. It provides an opportuni
ty both
to harness the private sector's skills in project management and to 
remove
at least part of a Pounds 2.6bn-Pounds 3bn project from the public se
ctor's
balance sheet.
But to achieve these benefits, the Treasury will need 
to abandon its purist
line that all the risk of such projects should be born
e by private
investors. Sticking to this line could delay or even kill off t
he project,
as Union Railways, the British Rail subsidiary set up to develop
 the link,
will tell ministers later today.
The essential point is that the 
private sector is not well suited to bear
the political and regulatory risks
 associated with the early stages of large
infrastructure projects. Before c
onstruction on the Chunnel link can
proceed, planning consents must be won, 
public inquiries conducted,
legislation passed and safety standards determin
ed. At each stage, there is
a danger that the project will be delayed and ex
tra costs imposed.
This particular project does not start with a happy histo
ry as far as
private companies are concerned. Several construction groups ha
ve already
spent money making proposals, only to have them rejected largely 
for
political reasons. There is also the overhang from the main Channel tunn
el
project, whose financial attraction has been reduced by a tightening of
s
afety regulations and the delay in building road and rail links.
It is doubt
ful whether private funds could be attracted at this stage and,
even if they
 could, a high risk premium would be required. Far better,
therefore, for th
e public sector to put up the Pounds 200m needed for the
project's next phas

uncertainty is largely out 
of the way. After that, it should be easier to
find a further Pounds 2.5bn-p

Constructing it is important not only to maximise the economi

The British government's vacillation over building a fast rail
 link to the
Channel tunnel has given a new meaning to the term 'two-speed E
urope'. When
the tunnel opens in May, trains from Paris to Calais will trave
l at 180mph
but complete the journey from Dover to London at about 47mph. La
st year,
France's President Francois Mitterrand rightly poked fun at the UK'
s
slow-coach approach.
Now it appears ministers are finally prepared to comm
it whatever public
funds are needed to make the project financially viable f
or private
investment. A beauty contest to choose the private partner will s
tart
shortly. Though the link will still not be ready until 2002, this
deter
mination to form a genuine partnership with the private sector is
welcome.
T
he government's original error was to think the private sector could handle

the Pounds 3bn project on its own. Public sector funds are needed because
th
e link will have social benefits that cannot easily be turned into
profitabl
e business. Active government involvement will also be vital to
overcome leg
islative and regulatory hurdles.
Nevertheless, the government's idea of usin
g the private sector to build the
link was not wholly misconceived. Competit
ive private enterprise is better
suited to design, build and operate such pr
ojects than the public sector.
Involving private investors should also minim
ise the burden on the public
purse.
Ministers' current idea of a joint ventu
re between public and private
sectors could provide the best of both worlds.
 But such a partnership will
not be easy to manage. For a start, government 
should smarten up its
negotiating act. Off-the-record suggestions that the p
ublic sector would put
up Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.5bn are not helpful, as they c
ould merely encourage
contractors to inflate their profit margins. The purpo
se of competitive
tendering should be to get the best value for money for ta
xpayers.
Even more tricky will be to allocate risk clearly between the publi
c and
private sectors. Will government compensate the private partner if
leg
islation to authorise the link is delayed or safety regulations are
tightene
d? Ministers will need to answer such questions carefully if they
are to avo
id destructive wrangles in the future.
Making a success of the fast rail lin
k is not simply an important goal in
its own right. Given its status as a fl
agship project, it will have
repercussions for the government's wider initia
tive for attracting private
capital for public infrastructure. Success with 
the Channel link will
convince companies that they can do business with gove
rnment.

The British government's vacillation over building a fast rail
 link to the
Channel tunnel has given a new meaning to the term 'two-speed E
urope'. When
the tunnel opens in May, trains from Paris to Calais will trave
l at 180mph
but complete the journey from Dover to London at about 47mph. La
st year,
France's President Francois Mitterrand rightly poked fun at the UK'
s
slow-coach approach.
Now it appears ministers are finally prepared to comm
it whatever public
funds are needed to make the project financially viable f
or private
investment. A beauty contest to choose the private partner will s
tart
shortly. Though the link will still not be ready until 2002, this
deter
mination to form a genuine partnership with the private sector is
welcome.
T
he government's original error was to think the private sector could handle

the Pounds 3bn project on its own. Public sector funds are needed because
th
e link will have social benefits that cannot easily be turned into
profitabl
e business. Active government involvement will also be vital to
overcome leg
islative and regulatory hurdles.
Nevertheless, the government's idea of usin
g the private sector to build the
link was not wholly misconceived. Competit
ive private enterprise is better
suited to design, build and operate such pr
ojects than the public sector.
Involving private investors should also minim
ise the burden on the public
purse.
Ministers' current idea of a joint ventu
re between public and private
sectors could provide the best of both worlds.
 But such a partnership will
not be easy to manage. For a start, government 
should smarten up its
negotiating act. Off-the-record suggestions that the p
ublic sector would put
up Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.5bn are not helpful, as they c
ould merely encourage
contractors to inflate their profit margins. The purpo
se of competitive
tendering should be to get the best value for money for ta
xpayers.
Even more tricky will be to allocate risk clearly between the publi
c and
private sectors. Will government compensate the private partner if
leg
islation to authorise the link is delayed or safety regulations are
tightene
d? Ministers will need to answer such questions carefully if they
are to avo
id destructive wrangles in the future.
Making a success of the fast rail lin
k is not simply an important goal in
its own right. Given its status as a fl
agship project, it will have
repercussions for the government's wider initia
tive for attracting private
capital for public infrastructure. Success with 
the Channel link will
convince companies that they can do business with gove
rnment.
