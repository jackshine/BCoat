A recent study by barrows (1997) indicates that S. tragus is a positive component of the habitat of the threatened Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard (Uta inornata). Because it is a non-native species, managers have expressed concern over the effects of S. tragus on this lizard species. The data presented by barrows, however, show that S. tragus is similar in appearance and microhabitat distribution as native species used by U. inornata for shading, though S. tragus does not provide a food source for the lizards, as native species do.\

1979, Allen and Allen 1984). However, where facilitation, rather than competition, drives succession, myccorhizal fungi may have a different role. Myccorhizal inoculations led to lower densities of S. kali, but no impact on myccorhizal grasses. This had an apparent detrimental effect on succession at this site (Allen and Allen 1988). S. tragus may also facilitate colonization by adding oxalate leachate to the soil. Cannon et al. (1995) found that leachate derived from S. tragus solubilized P from that inorganic-bound soil P pool, making this P available to colonizing plants.\
