LOANSSERVICE IS NOT A LENDER AND THEREFORE CANNOT DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE ULTIMATELY APPROVED FOR A SHORT TERM LOAN, NOR CAN WE DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT YOU MAY BE OFFERED. INSTEAD, WE FACILITATE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CONSUMERS LIKE YOU AND THE LENDERS IN OUR NETWORK. OUR PURPOSE AND GOAL IS TO MATCH YOU WITH ONE OR MORE LENDERS FROM WITHIN OUR NETWORK WHO CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH THE CASH YOU NEED IN AN EMERGENCY. WE WILL NEVER ACT AS AN AGENT OR REPRESENTATIVE FOR ANY OF OUR LENDERS, SO YOU CAN REST COMFORTABLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE FAIR AND COMPETITIVE OFFERS WITH ONLY THE BEST RATES AND FEES AVAILABLE TO YOU.
IN ORDER TO APPLY FOR A SHORT TERM LOAN THROUGH LOANSSERVICE, YOU SHOULD FIRST FILL OUT OUR SHORT, EASY AND SECURE APPLICATION. ONCE YOU CLICK TO SUBMIT IT, THIS INFORMATION WILL BE FORWARDED THROUGHOUT OUR NETWORK OF LENDERS WHO WILL REVIEW YOUR DETAILS AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN OFFER YOU A CREDIT. SINCE EACH LENDER IS DIFFERENT AND WE HAVE NO SAY IN THE RATES AND FEES YOU ARE CHARGED FOR A LOAN, WE URGE YOU TO TAKE THE TIME TO REVIEW THE DETAILS OF EACH OFFER YOU RECEIVE VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU ACCEPT OR DECLINE IT. ONCE YOU HAVE FOUND A LOAN OFFER THAT WORKS FOR YOU, YOU WILL BE ASKED TO PROVIDE YOUR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE; THIS BINDS YOU INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE LENDER WHICH MEANS THAT YOU ARE LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO ADHERE TO THE TERMS IN THE LOAN AGREEMENT. YOU ARE NEVER UNDER ANY OBLIGATION TO ACCEPT AN OFFER FROM ANY LENDER AND YOU MAY CANCEL THE PROCESS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PENALTY. WE WILL NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY CHARGES OR TERMS PRESENTED TO YOU BY ANY LENDER AND WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY BUSINESS AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND ANY LENDER.
MOST OF THE LENDERS IN OUR NETWORK WILL NOT PERFORM TRADITIONAL CREDIT CHECKS ON CONSUMERS, BUT THOSE WHO DO WILL TYPICALLY USE ALTERNATIVE MEANS SUCH AS TELETRACK OR DP. THESE METHODS WILL NOT IMPACT YOUR CREDIT SCORE IN ANY WAY AND SIMPLY TELL THE LENDER WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN BANKRUPTCY OR IF YOU HAVE ANY OUTSTANDING OR DEFAULT LOANS WITH OTHER SHORT TERM LENDERS.
