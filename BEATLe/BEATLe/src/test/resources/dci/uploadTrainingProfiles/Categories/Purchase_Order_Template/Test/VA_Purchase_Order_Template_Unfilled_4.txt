on the reverse, are collectively referred to as the Purchase Order. Supplier's commencement of performance, acknowledgement of this order by returning a copy,
informing Buyer in any manner of commencement of performance, or the receipt of Supplier's own form of acknowledgement shall conclusively evidence such
acceptance. This Purchase Order is the complete and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions of the agreement between Supplier and Buyer. No variation,
modification or addition to this Purchase Order, whether contained in Supplier's proposal, acceptance form or otherwise, will be effective without written consent
signed by Buyer's authorized representative. For purposes of use in Buyer’s Accounting procedures please return acceptance copy of this form within five (5) days.
Unless we hear otherwise from you within five (5) days of the date of this Purchase Order, we will consider you to have accepted our order as submitted.
2)
Whether submitted before or after this Purchase Order, any form of purchase order, invoice or other instrument used by Seller in the course of dealing with
Buyer shall be considered to be the convenience of Seller. None of the provisions of such a form shall modify or supplement this Purchase Order and Buyer objects to
any different or additional terms that it contains. Partial or complete performance of Seller’s obligations under this Purchase Order shall constitute Seller’s waiver of
any such different or additional terms. No course of prior dealings between the parties and no usage of the trade shall be relevant to supplement or explain any term
used in this agreement.
3)
Seller assumes toward Buyer all contractual and legal obligations that Buyer has assumed based on the content of this Purchase Order with any third party for
the provision of Materials. Further, and to the fullest extent permitted by law if any dispute regarding the Materials arises between Buyer and any such third party,
Seller shall indemnify and save Buyer harmless from any and all losses, including but not limited to attorneys’ fees on account thereof. The terms and conditions of
such applicable contractual obligations are available for review at Buyer’s main office upon written request to Buyer by Seller.
4)

Where submittal approval is required, do not ship the material until you have received approval. Seller will bear the cost of premature shipping.

agreed delivery date or dates or any time after the agreed delivery day or dates. Early deliveries may, at Buyer’s option be returned at Seller’s risk and expense. Late
deliveries may, at Buyer’s option, subject to this Purchase Order to cancellation or entitle Buyer to deduct any damages caused by the late delivery from any amount
due to Seller. Any such deduction shall not, however, preclude Buyer from asserting a claim against Seller for additional damages arising from late delivery. Any

Purchase Order, the total quantity of each type of material which Seller has in stock or on firm order shall be determined and the amount of each shall be allocated on
a pro rata basis to all of Seller’s outstanding and uncompleted orders for which such material would be required; subject, however, to the limitation that the amount so
allocated to this Purchase Order shall not exceed the amount necessary to perform the uncompleted portion of this Purchase Order.
11)

constitute approval of or acquiescence in a default under this Purchase Order, except as may be specifically agreed in writing.
12)
If Buyer consults or retains an attorney because of any failure by Seller to perform any obligation under this Purchase Order or because of any dispute with
Seller as to the meaning of, or performance under, this Purchase Order, regardless of whether or not litigation or other grievance procedure is commenced, Seller shall
