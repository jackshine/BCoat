property from a third party, such as a bank. Buyer must notify Owner of the amount of financing

within 30 days of obtaining such financing.
The down payment amount of _________________ has been agreed to by the parties and is to be

days.

This agreement is secured by the home. Buyer’s failure to pay the mortgage payment when due

at any time. Notification of the choice of servicing company will be provided to the Owner no
later than 30 days before payment should be sent to the servicing company.
Owner may change servicing companies at any time without giving prior notice to Owner.
However, Owner must notify Buyer or have the new servicing company notify Buyer of any
changes to choice of loan servicing company at least 30 days prior to the change in mailing
address for monthly payment. Any fees incurred due to the Owner’s failure to provide Buyer
with notice, either directly or from the service company, and the Buyer’s sending payment to the
incorrect address shall be paid by Owner.
This contract is full in its entirety. Any additions must be made in writing and amended to this
contract.
