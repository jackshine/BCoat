CITY OF ITHACA

FULL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FORM (FEAF)
Purpose: This Full Environmental Assessment Form (FEAF) is designed to help applicants and agencies determine, in an orderly
manner, whether a project or action may be significant. The question of whether an action may be significant is not always easy to
answer. Frequently, there are aspects of a proposed action that are subjective or immeasurable. It is also understood those who
determine significance may have little or no formal knowledge of the environment or may not be aware of the broader concerns
affecting the question of significance.
The FEAF is intended to provide a method whereby applicants and agencies can be assured the determination process has been
orderly, comprehensive in nature, yet flexible enough to allow introduction of information to fit a project or action.

FEAF Components:
Part 1:
Part 2:

Part 3:

Provides objective data and information about a given action and its site. By identifying basic project data, it assists
in a review of the analysis that takes place in Parts 2 and 3.
Focuses on identifying the range of possible impacts that may occur from a project or action. It provides guidance as
to whether an impact is likely to be considered small to moderate or whether it is a potentially large impact. The form
also identifies whether an impact can be mitigated or reduced.
If any impact in Part 2 is identified as potentially large, then Part 3 is used to evaluate whether or not the impact is
actually important.
THIS AREA IS FOR LEAD AGENCY USE ONLY
DETERMINATION OF SIGNIFICANCE—TYPE I AND UNLISTED ACTIONS

Identify the portions of FEAF completed for this action: __Part 1 __Part 2 __Part 3
Upon review of the information recorded on this FEAF (Parts, 2, and 3, if appropriate), and any other supporting information, and
considering both the magnitude and importance of each impact, it is reasonably determined by the Lead Agency that:
__A. The Proposed Action will not result in any large and important impact(s) and will not have a significant impact on the
environment; therefore, A NEGATIVE DECLARATION WILL BE PREPARED.
__B. Although the proposed action could have a significant impact on the environment, there will not be a significant effect
for this Unlisted Action, because the mitigation measures described in PART 3 have been required; therefore, A
*
CONDITIONED NEGATIVE DECLARATION WILL BE PREPARED.
__C. The proposed action may result in one or more large and important impacts that may have a significant impact on the
environment; therefore, A POSITIVE DECLARATION WILL BE PREPARED.
*

A Conditioned Negative Declaration is only valid for Unlisted Actions.
