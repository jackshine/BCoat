NIPPON STEEL & SUMIKIN BUSSAN CORPORATION (9810)
Consolidated Financial Statements for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015

1. Analysis of Operating Results and Financial Position
Nippon Steel Trading Co., Ltd. merged with Sumikin Bussan Corporation in October 1, 2013. For this reason, the figures
for the fiscal year under review differ considerably from the previous fiscal year.
Accordingly, the sections (1) Analysis of Operating Results and (2) Analysis of Financial Position do not include
comparisons with the previous fiscal year.
(1) Analysis of Operating Results
A. Operating Results for the Period
The world economy during the fiscal year under review weakened overall. The Chinese economy continued to slow, and
other newly emerging economies generally also showed decelerated growth. Economically advanced countries slowly
recovered; the U.S. economy recovered against a backdrop of an improved employment situation and robust personal
consumption, and the European economies rallied following the debt crisis.
The Japanese economy saw a rise in corporate earnings and an improved employment situation due to the Japanese
government’s economic policies and the Bank of Japan’s monetary policies, which helped rectify the excessively high
yen. On the other hand, consumer spending fell amid a continued decline in consumer sentiment, which was due to the
rise in prices from the weaker yen, and the lengthening of the negative reaction after a last-minute rise in demand before
a consumption tax increase.
Group earnings in the fiscal year under review featured net sales of ¥2,104.6 billion, operating income of ¥28.6 billion,
ordinary income of ¥30.5 billion, and net income of ¥17.4 billion.
Earnings for reportable segments are as below.
(Steel)
Domestic demand for steel was poor. Automobile sales fell due to the consumption tax hike, and while construction
equipment sales were expected to grow in conjunction with recovery and restoration work, the pace of recovery was
generally slowed down by a shortage of manpower. The Company saw a decrease in domestic sales volume, but an
increase in average sales price. Regarding the situation overseas, the supply-demand balance continued to ease in Asia,
the Company’s main market, and while overseas markets have softened, the Company’s export sales increased as a result
of various initiatives designed to capture overseas demand. It should be noted that prices were on a par with the previous
fiscal year due to the weakening yen. As a result, net sales in the Steel segment reached ¥1,679.6 billion, and ordinary
income reached ¥20.6 billion.
(Industrial Supply and Infrastructure)
In the Industrial Supply and Infrastructure business, net sales reached ¥92.4 billion and ordinary income reached ¥3.1
billion. These results were due to a rise in Russia-bound exports of steel products for pipelines, and the contribution to
earnings from solar power generation projects.
(Textiles)
In the Textiles business, sales to key customers fell due to the consumption tax hike and the unseasonable weather in the
summer. Business conditions were challenging; the yen rapidly weakened during the fiscal year under review and the
corporate performance of some of the Company’s associates deteriorated. As a result, net sales in the Textiles segment
were ¥178.1 billion, and ordinary income was ¥3.6 billion.
(Foodstuffs)
In the Foodstuffs business, the imported meat business performed well thanks to a rise in sales of imported pork products.
Net sales reached ¥152.9 billion, and ordinary income reached ¥2.9 billion.

Consolidated Financial Statements for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015

B. Outlook for Next Period
The Company’s consolidated earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 is as follows: In the second
quarter (cumulative), the Company expects net sales of ¥1,030.0 billion, operating income of ¥13.5 billion, ordinary
income of ¥13.5 billion, and a quarterly net income attributable to owners of parent of ¥7.8 billion. For the full year, the
Company forecasts net sales of ¥2,120.0 billion, operating income of ¥29.5 billion, ordinary income of ¥31.0 billion and
net income attributable to owners of parent of ¥17.5 billion.
(2) Analysis of Financial Position
A. Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets
Total assets at the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review were ¥692.8 billion (up ¥50.5 billion from the end of
the previous fiscal year) due to an increase in notes and accounts receivable - trade and inventories. Total liabilities
increased to ¥509.2 billion (up ¥24.4 billion from the end of the previous fiscal year) due to an increase in loans payable.
Total net assets reached ¥183.6 billion (up ¥26.1 billion from the end of the previous fiscal year) due to the recording of
net income, which offset the payment of dividends.
B. Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year under review increased ¥1.3 billion from the end of the previous
period to ¥27.3 billion.
While there was a rise in notes and accounts receivable - trade and inventories, net cash provided by operating activities
in the fiscal year under review was ¥5.2 billion due to net income. Net cash used in investing activities was ¥11.5 billion
due to the Company’s overseas investments and the acquisitions of property, plant and equipment by overseas
subsidiaries. Net cash provided by financing activities was ¥4.0 billion due to an increase in repayment of loans payable
following an increase in working capital.

* Cash flows from operating activities are taken from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
* Interest-bearing debts include all those on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on which interest is being paid.
* Interest payments are taken from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
(3) Basic Policy on Distribution of Profits, and Dividends in Period under Review and Subsequent Period
The Company recognizes the importance of setting a policy on the distribution of profits to shareholders. The Company’s
fundamental dividend policy is to pay dividends of around 20% of consolidated net income while striving to improve its
financial health.

NIPPON STEEL & SUMIKIN BUSSAN CORPORATION (9810)
Consolidated Financial Statements for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015

From the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, the Company will increase the consolidated dividend payout ratio from
around 20% to 25-30%.
As previously announced, a year-end dividend of ¥6 per share (¥12 for the term after adding the ¥6 interim dividend) will
be proposed at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders.
The Company is planning an annual dividend of ¥15 per share (¥7.5 interim dividend) for the dividends of surplus for the
next term.

2. Management Policy
(1) Basic Policy on Company Management
NIPPON STEEL & SUMIKIN BUSSSAN CORPORATION will aim to achieve our guiding principles of corporate
management: 1. Strengthening and expanding the four areas of business that make NIPPON STEEL & SUMIKIN
BUSSAN CORPORATION the core trading company of the NIPPON STEEL & SUMITOMO METAL
CORPORATION GROUP; 2. Accelerating global strategies; 3. Bringing to bear all of our strengths as a multiple
specialty trading company; and 4. Enforcing strict corporate compliance.

(2) Medium/Long-Term Company Management Strategy and Issues Facing Company
The global economic situation is expected to slowly recover on the whole. However, there are many areas of concern,
including a move to change U.S. financial policy, the future prospects of China and other newly emerging economies, the
effects of downfall in crude oil prices, and geopolitical risks such as the situations in Ukraine and the Middle East. It is
therefore reasonable to expect continued instability.
The Japanese economy is expected to recover slowly amid continued improvement in the employment and income
environment. However the business environment surrounding the Group appears to be increasing in severity; there are
fears of a global economic downturn, and expectations that demand for steel products in April to June will fall to their
levels almost as low as the time of the Lehman Shock.
The Company sets a Medium-Term Management Plan for FY2015-FY2017 taking into account this state of affairs.
<Outline of Medium-Term Management Plan >
Aim to fulfill the Company’s social responsibility as a trading company that offers products and services concerning food,
shelter and clothing, and for achieving sustainable growth upon on a robust management foundation.
<Outline of Strategy and Action Plan>
1. Promote growth strategies building on our strengths
(1) Gain greater market share in the steel market
(2) Develop automobile parts and infrastructure businesses globally
(3) Strengthen/expand apparel ODM and solutions businesses
(4) Strengthen/expand overseas foodstuffs business
2. Maintain/improve our industry-leading competitiveness
(1) Pursue safety, reliability and quality
(2) Improve productivity and operational efficiency
(3) Establish sound organizational and administrative infrastructure
<Investment of Managerial Resources>
1. Establish investment framework of a ¥45.0 billion for examining strategic investments, including mergers and
acquisitions
2. Continue expanding business, but keep staff numbers at the current level of 1,850-1,900 members of staff
(non-consolidated, includes domestic and overseas secondees) by improving operational efficiency.

Accounting Standards, while giving consideration to inter-period comparability and inter-company comparability.

situation inside and outside Japan.

NIPPON STEEL & SUMIKIN BUSSAN CORPORATION (9810)
Consolidated Financial Statements for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015

(5) Notes on Consolidated Financial Statements
(Notes on Going Concern Assumption)
Not applicable.
(Changes of Accounting Policies)
(Application of Accounting Standards on Retirement Benefits)
As of the consolidated fiscal year under review, the Company adopted the Accounting Standards for Retirement Benefits
(Accounting Standards Board of Japan [ASBJ], Statement No. 26; hereinafter “Retirement Benefit Accounting
Standards”) and the Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits (ASBJ Guidance No. 25; hereinafter, the
“Guidance”) in accordance with the provisions stipulated in the main clause of Paragraph 35 of the Retirement Benefit
Accounting Standards and in the main clause of Paragraph 67 of the Guidance. Consequently, the Group has changed the
methods used to calculate retirement benefit obligations and service costs. More specifically, the attribution method for
projected retirement benefits has been changed from a service period basis to a projected benefit basis. Further, in order
to reflect the projected payment period for retirement benefits and the individual amounts associated with each projected
payment period, the method to determine the discount rate has been changed from average period from expected payment
day to a single weighted average discount rate.
The Accounting Standards for Retirement Benefits have been applied in accordance with the transitional treatment
stipulated in Paragraph 37 of the Retirement Benefit Accounting Standards. Accordingly, the amount generated by using
the new method to calculate retirement benefit obligations and service costs has been reflected in retained earnings from
the beginning of the fiscal year under review.
The impact of this change upon retained earnings at the beginning of the fiscal year under review and on the gain/loss of
the fiscal year under review was negligible.
(Changes to Presentation Method)
(Consolidated Statement of Income)
Foreign exchange gains, which was handled as “Non-operating income; Other” in the previous fiscal year, has been
allocated its own reportable segment from the fiscal year under review as it accounted for more than 10% of
non-operating income. To represent this change in presentation method, the consolidated financial statements of the
previous fiscal year have been rearranged.
Consequently, the ¥1,532 million presented in the consolidated statement of income for the previous fiscal year under
“Non-operating income; Other” has been changed to “Foreign exchange gains: ¥181 million; Other: ¥1,351 million.”
(Segment Information, Etc.)
[Segment Information]
1. Overview of Reportable Segments
Reportable segments of the Company are those constituent units of the Company for which separate financial
information can be derived. These segments are subject to periodic examination in order for the Board of Directors to
make decisions on the allocation of management resources and to evaluate earnings.
The Company is primarily engaged in the sale of steel, industrial supply and infrastructure, textiles, foodstuffs, and
other products in Japan and abroad. For each category of product handled, it establishes sales divisions to draft
comprehensive strategies for Japan and abroad and conduct business activities accordingly.
Thus, the Company consists of four business divisions based on the products it handles and has four reportable
segments: Steel, Industrial Supply and Infrastructure, Textiles, and Foodstuffs.
The major products handled in the Steel segment are steel plates and sheets, steel pipes and tubes, bars and special steel,
structural products raw materials and fuels, and machinery. The major products handled in the Industrial Supply and

- 14 -

NIPPON STEEL & SUMIKIN BUSSAN CORPORATION (9810)
Consolidated Financial Statements for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015

Infrastructure segment are industrial machinery, non-ferrous metals, cast and forged products, railroad machinery. Also
in this segment, industrial estates are developed and sold, and power generation facilities developed through equity
method affiliates. The major products handled in the Textiles segment are textiles products and textile materials. The
major products handled in the Foodstuffs segment are imported meats and sea food.
2. Methods of Calculating Amounts of Each Reporting Segment’s Net Sales, Income/Loss, Assets and Other Items
Profits of reportable segments are based on ordinary income. Inter-segment trade is treated as inter-company trade, and
as such is based on market prices, etc.

1. “Other” is for items not included under “reportable segments,” and it includes real estate business.
2. The downward adjustment of ¥6 million in “segment income (loss)” represents the elimination of inter-segment trade.
3. The downward adjustment of ¥5,290 million in “segment assets” represents ¥7,651 million in the Group-wide assets not
allocated to any reportable segment and an elimination of ¥2,360 million in inter-segment trade. The Group-wide assets consist
primarily of the parent company’s cash and deposits.
4. The total income (loss) of the “reportable segments” and “other” align with the ordinary income in the consolidated statement
of income excepting the downward adjustment of ¥6 million.

The downward adjustment of ¥7,535 million in “segment assets” represents ¥8,662 million in the Group-wide assets not
allocated to any reportable segment and an elimination of ¥1,126 million in inter-segment trade. The Group-wide assets consist
