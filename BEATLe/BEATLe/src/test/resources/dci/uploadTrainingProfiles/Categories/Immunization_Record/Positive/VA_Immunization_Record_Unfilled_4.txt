SECTION F: MENINGOCOCCAL WAIVER
Maryland Law requires that all students living in on-campus student housing must be vaccinated against meningococcal disease
or complete a waiver. We strongly recommend that you receive the vaccine as opposed to waiving.
DO NOT COMPLETE THIS SECTION IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE MENINGOCOCCAL (MENINGITIS) VACCINE OR
IF YOU WILL NOT RESIDE IN GRAD/UNDERGRAD CAMPUS HOUSING.
Meningitis information can be found here: http://phpa.dhmh.maryland.gov/OIDEOR/IMMUN/SitePages/meningococcal-disease.aspx
Individuals 18 years of age and older may sign a written waiver choosing not to be vaccinated against meningococcal disease. For
individuals under 18 years of age, the parent or guardian of the individual must review the information on the risks of the disease
and sign this waiver that he/she has chosen not to have the child vaccinated.
I have reviewed information on the risk of meningococcal disease and the effectiveness and availability of the vaccine.
I understand that meningococcal disease is a rare but life-threatening illness.
I understand that Maryland law requires that an individual enrolled in an institution of higher education in Maryland who resides in
campus student housing shall receive vaccination or sign this waiver.
I am 18 years of age or older and I choose to waive receipt of the meningococcal vaccine:
