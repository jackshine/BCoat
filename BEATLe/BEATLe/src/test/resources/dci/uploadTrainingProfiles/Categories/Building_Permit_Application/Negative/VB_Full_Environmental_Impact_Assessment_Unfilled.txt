Appendix A
State Environmental Quality Review

FULL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FORM
Purpose: The full EAF is designed to help applicants and agencies determine, in an orderly manner, whether a project or action may
be significant. The question of whether an action may be significant is not always easy to answer. Frequently, there are aspects of
a project that are subjective or unmeasurable. It is also understood that those who determine significance may have little or no formal
knowledge of the environment or may not be technically expert in environmental analysis. In addition, many who have knowledge
in one particular area may not be aware of the broader concerns affecting the question of significance.
The full EAF is intended to provide a method whereby applicants and agencies can be assured that the determination process
has been orderly, comprehensive in nature, yet flexible enough to allow introduction of information to fit a project or action.
Full EAF Components: The full EAF is comprised of three parts:
Part 1:

Provides objective data and information about a given project and its site. By identifying basic project data, it assists
a reviewer in the analysis that takes place in Parts 2 and 3.

Part 2: Focuses on identifying the range of possible impacts that may occur from a project or action. It provides guidance
as to whether an impact is likely to be considered small to moderate or whether it is a potentially-large impact. The
form also identifies whether an impact can be mitigated or reduced.
Part 3: If any impact in Part 2 is identified as potentially-large, then Part 3 is used to evaluate whether or not the impact is
actually important.

THIS AREA FOR LEAD AGENCY USE ONLY

DETERMINATION OF SIGNIFICANCE -- Type 1 and Unlisted Actions
Identify the Portions of EAF completed for this project:
Part 1
Part 2
Part 3
Upon review of the information recorded on this EAF (Parts 1 and 2 and 3 if appropriate), and any other supporting information, and
considering both the magnitude and importance of each impact, it is reasonably determined by the lead agency that:
A.

The project will not result in any large and important impact(s) and, therefore, is one which will not have a
significant impact on the environment, therefore a negative declaration will be prepared.

B.

Although the project could have a significant effect on the environment, there will not be a significant effect
for this Unlisted Action because the mitigation measures described in PART 3 have been required, therefore
a CONDITIONED negative declaration will be prepared.*

C.

The project may result in one or more large and important impacts that may have a significant impact on the
environment, therefore a positive declaration will be prepared.

*A Conditioned Negative Declaration is only valid for Unlisted Actions

PART 1--PROJECT INFORMATION
Prepared by Project Sponsor
NOTICE: This document is designed to assist in determining whether the action proposed may have a significant effect on the
environment. Please complete the entire form, Parts A through E. Answers to these questions will be considered as part of the
application for approval and may be subject to further verification and public review. Provide any additional information you believe
will be needed to complete Parts 2 and 3.
It is expected that completion of the full EAF will be dependent on information currently available and will not involve new studies,
research or investigation. If information requiring such additional work is unavailable, so indicate and specify each instance.

PART 2 - PROJECT IMPACTS AND THEIR MAGNITUDE
Responsibility of Lead Agency
General Information (Read Carefully)
In completing the form the reviewer should be guided by the question: Have my responses and determinations been
!
reasonable? The reviewer is not expected to be an expert environmental analyst.
The Examples provided are to assist the reviewer by showing types of impacts and wherever possible the threshold of
!
magnitude that would trigger a response in column 2. The examples are generally applicable throughout the State and for
most situations. But, for any specific project or site other examples and/or lower thresholds may be appropriate for a
Potential Large Impact response, thus requiring evaluation in Part 3.
The impacts of each project, on each site, in each locality, will vary. Therefore, the examples are illustrative and have been
!
offered as guidance. They do not constitute an exhaustive list of impacts and thresholds to answer each question.
The number of examples per question does not indicate the importance of each question.
!
!
In identifying impacts, consider long term, short term and cumulative effects.
Instructions (Read carefully)
Answer each of the 20 questions in PART 2. Answer Yes if there will be any impact.
a.
b.
Maybe answers should be considered as Yes answers.
If answering Yes to a question then check the appropriate box(column 1 or 2)to indicate the potential size of the impact. If
c.
impact threshold equals or exceeds any example provided, check column 2. If impact will occur but threshold is lower than
example, check column 1.
d.
Identifying that an Impact will be potentially large (column 2) does not mean that it is also necessarily significant. Any
large impact must be evaluated in PART 3 to determine significance. Identifying an impact in column 2 simply asks that it
be looked at further.
If reviewer has doubt about size of the impact then consider the impact as potentially large and proceed to PART 3.
e.
f.
If a potentially large impact checked in column 2 can be mitigated by change(s) in the project to a small to moderate
impact, also check the Yes box in column 3. A No response indicates that such a reduction is not possible. This must be
explained in Part 3.

Part 3 - EVALUATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPACTS
Responsibility of Lead Agency
Part 3 must be prepared if one or more impact(s) is considered to be potentially large, even if the impact(s) may
be mitigated.
Instructions (If you need more space, attach additional sheets)
Discuss the following for each impact identified in Column 2 of Part 2:
1.

Briefly describe the impact.

2.

Describe (if applicable) how the impact could be mitigated or reduced to a small to moderate impact by
project change(s).

3.

Based on the information available, decide if it is reasonable to conclude that this impact is important.
To answer the question of importance, consider:
! The probability of the impact occurring
! The duration of the impact
! Its irreversibility, including permanently lost resources of value
! Whether the impact can or will be controlled
! The regional consequence of the impact
! Its potential divergence from local needs and goals
! Whether known objections to the project relate to this impact.
