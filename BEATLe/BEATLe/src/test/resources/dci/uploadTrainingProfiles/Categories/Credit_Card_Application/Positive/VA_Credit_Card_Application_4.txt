New Account Identification Requirements: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, U.S. Federal
law requires financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person (individuals and businesses) who opens an
account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow
us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.
Agreement and Personal Guarantee
By signing below, I certify that I am authorized to submit this application on behalf of the business named above ("Applicant") and that all
information and documents made in connection with this application, including federal and state income tax returns (if any), are true, correct and
complete. I authorize Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Bank”) to obtain balance and payoff information on all accounts requiring payoff as a condition of
approving this application and to obtain at any time consumer and business reports from and to report credit information to others, including the
Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, about me and my business, both in connection with this application as well as any review,
extension or renewal of the credit granted pursuant to this application. I agree to notify Bank promptly of any material change in such information. I
acknowledge that (i) this application is subject to final approval of the Applicant and its owners, and that (ii) additional information (i.e., financial
statements and/or tax returns) may be required in order for Bank to make a final credit decision. A facsimile of my signature, in any capacity, may be
used as evidence of the Applicant’s acceptance of these agreements. Note: Except in Arizona, if the business owner is married, a spouse’s signature is
not required unless he or she is the co-owner of the business. If the Applicant is a legal entity, all owners must sign below and include their titles and
provide information required on the Personal Information Section above.
By signing below, I also, in my individual capacity (even though I may place a title or other designation next to my signature), jointly and severally
unconditionally guarantee and promise to pay to Bank all indebtedness of the Applicant at any time arising under or relating to any credit requested
through this application, as well as any extensions, increases or renewals of that indebtedness. As guarantor, I waive (i) presentment, demand, protest,
notice of protest, and notice of non-payment; (ii) any defense arising by reason of any defense of the Applicant or other guarantor; and (iii) the right to
require Bank to proceed against the Applicant or any other guarantor, to pursue any remedy in connection with the guaranteed indebtedness, or to
notify guarantor of any additional indebtedness incurred by the Applicant, or of any changes in the Applicant’s financial condition. I also authorize Bank,
without notice or prior consent, to (i) extend, modify, compromise, accelerate, renew, increase or otherwise change the terms of the guaranteed
indebtedness; (ii) proceed against one or more guarantors without proceeding against the Applicant or another guarantor; and (iii) release or
substitute any party to the indebtedness or this guaranty. I agree (i) I will pay Bank’s costs and attorney’s fees in enforcing this guaranty; (ii) this
guaranty will be governed by South Dakota law; and (iii) this guaranty shall benefit Bank and its successors and assigns; and (iv) an electronic
facsimile of my signature, in any capacity, may be used as evidence of my agreement to the terms of this guaranty.
For Wells Fargo® Business Secured card applicants only: I acknowledge that it is a condition of the granting of the Business Secured card account
(“Account”) that I open a business account with the Bank (“Collateral Account”). In consideration of the opening of the Account I grant to Bank a
security interest in, assign, transfer and set over to Bank all rights, title and interest I may have in the Collateral Account, every addition to and
replacement or renewal of the Collateral Account, and the proceeds of the same, as security for the obligations of the Applicant under this Agreement
and authorized signature, the Business Secured card Customer Agreement (“Customer Agreement”) (including but not limited to interest, fees and
costs), and the Terms Applicable to Collateral Account. I agree that Bank has the right to redeem, collect and withdraw any part of the full amount of
the Collateral Account upon default under the Customer Agreement, or in the event my Account is terminated by Bank for any reason. I agree that if
my Business Secured card account is closed for any reason, the Collateral Account shall remain on deposit for 30 days. Withholding Status: Under
penalties of perjury, I certify that (1) the Social Security Number provided for this application is my correct Taxpayer Identification Number, and
(2) I am not subject to backup withholding, either because I have not been notified that I am subject to backup withholding or the IRS has
notified me that I am no longer subject to backup withholding. Note: You must cross out item (2) above if you have been notified by the IRS that
you are currently subject to backup withholding because of underreporting interest or dividends on your tax return.
For Wells Fargo Equipment Express® and Wells Fargo® Business Platinum credit card applicants only: By signing below, I agree on behalf of the
Applicant to be bound by the terms of the Customer Agreement and other written documentation that will be sent to Applicant and to pay Bank’s costs
and attorneys’ fees in enforcing the Customer Agreement and other written documentation. I further agree that use of any feature of the Equipment
Express loan or Wells Fargo Business Platinum credit card may be used as evidence of the foregoing authorizations, acceptances, and agreements. If
approved, the actual credit granted may be less than the preferred amount. If the actual credit granted is less than the preferred amount for my
Wells Fargo Business Platinum credit card, individual credit lines will be reduced proportionately.
Optional Credit Protection Program: defers payments on your Business Platinum credit card account for up to 12 months if you become disabled
and unable to work. Credit Protection is a temporary deferment product only. It is not a waiver or cancellation of any amounts due on your credit
account. Fees will be assessed on your average daily balance. You agree to pay the Credit Protection fees ($0.35/$100 of average daily balance) as
charged based on the average daily balance for the Primary Account and all Linked Accounts. If Credit Protection fees are not paid in full each month,
fees will become part of the account balance and interest will accrue. A disability is defined in the Customer Agreement as an illness or injury that
precludes you from performing your daily work duties, subject to certain exceptions. To request deferment of your Business Platinum card payments,
you must be certified disabled by a medical physician. In order to be eligible for deferment, you must have made one or more monthly payments and
paid at least one Credit Protection monthly fee before the deferment is requested and approved. The number of months of deferment cannot exceed
the number of months paid into Credit Protection. The maximum deferment period is 12 months. Once you have enrolled, you will receive complete
Terms and Conditions for the Credit Protection Program. Credit Protection is available in all states.
