Full Environmental Assessment Form
Part 2 - Identification of Potential Project Impacts

Agency Use Only [If applicable]
Project :
Date :

Part 2 is to be completed by the lead agency. Part 2 is designed to help the lead agency inventory all potential resources that could
be affected by a proposed project or action. We recognize that the lead agency=s reviewer(s) will not necessarily be environmental
professionals. So, the questions are designed to walk a reviewer through the assessment process by providing a series of questions that
can be answered using the information found in Part 1. To further assist the lead agency in completing Part 2, the form identifies the
most relevant questions in Part 1 that will provide the information needed to answer the Part 2 question. When Part 2 is completed, the
lead agency will have identified the relevant environmental areas that may be impacted by the proposed activity.
If the lead agency is a state agency and the action is in any Coastal Area, complete the Coastal Assessment Form before proceeding
with this assessment.
Tips for completing Part 2:
• Review all of the information provided in Part 1.
• Review any application, maps, supporting materials and the Full EAF Workbook.
• Answer each of the 18 questions in Part 2.
• If you answer “Yes” to a numbered question, please complete all the questions that follow in that section.
• If you answer “No” to a numbered question, move on to the next numbered question.
• Check appropriate column to indicate the anticipated size of the impact.
• Proposed projects that would exceed a numeric threshold contained in a question should result in the reviewing agency
checking the box “Moderate to large impact may occur.”
• The reviewer is not expected to be an expert in environmental analysis.
•
If you are not sure or undecided about the size of an impact, it may help to review the sub-questions for the general
question and consult the workbook.
• When answering a question consider all components of the proposed activity, that is, the Awhole action@.
• Consider the possibility for long-term and cumulative impacts as well as direct impacts.
• Answer the question in a reasonable manner considering the scale and context of the project.
