Federal Regulations Regarding Financial Aid Dependency Status
According to federal regulations, financial aid eligibility is based on the family as the first source of the student’s support. There
are questions on the FAFSA and the California Dream Act Application that determine independent status. For your convenience,
page 2 of this appeal form provides a review of these items.
 If you answer “YES” to ANY of the questions, you are considered independent.
 If you answer “NO” to ALL of the questions, then you are considered dependent, and you must provide parental information.
There is an appeal process, by which a financial aid advisor may decide that a student who does not meet any of the independent
criteria can be treated as an independent student. This is called a dependency override, and is considered on a case-by-case and year
-by-year basis.

Circumstances That May Meet Dependency Status Appeal Criteria
You must clearly demonstrate an adverse family situation in order to be considered independent for financial aid purposes. Adverse
family situations may include: physical or emotional abuse, severe estrangement, abandonment, parental drug or alcohol abuse,
mental incapacity or other circumstances.

Non-eligible Criteria for Independence:
Federal guidelines stipulate the following conditions do not solely qualify as circumstances meriting a dependency override:
 Parents refusing to contribute to your education;
 Parents unwilling to provide information on the FAFSA or documents for verification;
 Parents not claiming you as a dependent for income tax purposes;
 Student demonstrating total self-sufficiency.
