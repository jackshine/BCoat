Attached Accessory Dwelling Units: A portion of a single-family dwelling
unit may be converted to one accessory apartment which may have a bathroom and
kitchen. An attached ADU must comply with the following standards:
(a)
One additional improved off-street parking space must be provided for the
residents of the accessory apartment and if an attached garage is
converted to an accessory unit, additional parking spaces must be
improved elsewhere on the site to replace those lost.
(b)
One unit must be owner-occupied. The property owner shall record a
deed restriction with the Benton County Auditor’s Office. The document shall be in a
form prescribed by the Planning Director and include a description of the location and
size of the ADU and a covenant that one (1) of the dwelling units is, and will continue to
be, occupied by the owner of the property as the owner’s principal and permanent
residence for as long as the other unit is being rented or otherwise occupied. The owner
shall maintain residency at least six (6) months out of the year and at no time receive
rent for, or otherwise allow to occupy the owner unit when absent the remainder of the
year. Falsely certifying owner occupancy shall be considered a violation of the zoning
ordinance and is subject to enforcement action.

(b)
Minimum lot size – 10,000 square feet;
(c)
Detached accessory structures are subject to the provisions of Chapter 18.27;
(d)
Total floor area: The total gross floor area of an ADU shall not exceed forty (40)

is in addition to the two (2) off-street parking spaces required for the primary

compatible with the primary dwelling unit. Compatible includes coordination of
architectural style, exterior building materials, color, roofing material, form and

covenant that one (1) of the dwelling units is, and will continue to be, occupied by
the owner of the property as the owner’s principal and permanent residence for
as long as the other unit is being rented or otherwise occupied. The owner shall
maintain residency at least six (6) months out of the year and at no time receive
rent for, or otherwise allow to, occupy the owner unit when absent the remainder
of the year. Falsely certifying owner occupancy shall be considered a violation of
the zoning ordinance and is subject to enforcement action;

Kennewick zoning ordinance permitted detached ADUs. Nevertheless, for up to
twelve (12) months from the effective date of this section, a home or lot which
has had a detached ADU established prior to the adoption of this section, but
which cannot comply with above items (h) and/or (i), or the setback requirements
of this section, may be considered through a conditional use permit process. All
other ADU provisions and applicable building code requirements shall apply
when legalizing the detached ADU. (Ord. 5528 Sec. 1, 2013: Ord. 5204 Sec. 8,
