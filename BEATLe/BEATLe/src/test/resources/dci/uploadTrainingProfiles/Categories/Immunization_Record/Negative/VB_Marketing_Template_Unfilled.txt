1. Executive Summary (Done Last)
Keep in mind that not everyone will read every page of your marketing plan.  Your executive summary should highlight the most important parts.  It’s an overview of your marketing plan.
As you go through the process of writing your plan you will refine your ideas and develop new strategies.  By writing the executive summary at the very last you will be able to provide a holistic overview of your marketing plan.
It is recommended that you include the following points in your executive summary:
Brief description of products or services
Define target market
Competitive advantage
You need to tailor your offer so that your target customers believe that it is superior to what is offered by your competition - this is your competitive advantage. 
Competitive advantage can come from any element of your marketing mix - creating a superior product, more attractive designs, better service, more effective distribution or better advertising.
Competitive advantage comes down to understanding what your customer values, delivering it and doing it better than your competitor.
Positioning statement
Positioning is the way your product or service is defined by consumers.  For example a consumer would describe a Ferrari as a prestige, high performance sports car.  This perception by the consumer is due to a strategy developed by Ferrari to position itself in the prestige segment of the car market with a competitive advantage based on high performance and exclusivity.
After you have worked on the rest of your marketing strategy you will know where your business is positioned in your market and how you are different to your competitors.
Anticipated sales, profits and market share

2. Market and Situation Analysis

Economic environment
Here you should look at the factors that affect your consumers’ purchasing power and spending patterns.  What is the economic environment that you are operating in? Is it a growth, recovery or recession? Will it be easy to find staff?  What is the current interest rate i.e. is it increasing or decreasing? What is consumer confidence like?
Social environment
What are the social and demographic trends?  Is the population aging? Is there an increase in the number of people who have English as a second language?  Are family structures changing?  Are there changes in the level of education?
Technical environment
The technological environment changes rapidly.  You need to make sure that you are aware of trends in your industry and other industries could affect your business.  New technologies create new markets and can influence you consumers and competitors.
Industry environment
What are the trends in your industry?  Are there new entrants in the market? Has a substitute product been introduced?  Are there changes in industry practices or new benchmarks to use?
Competitive environment
What are your competitors doing?  How many competitors do you have?  What is your advantage over your competitors?  Is the market large enough to support you and your competitors?
SWOT  Analysis 

Strength
superior customer service
excellent store location
a unique product
Weakness
poorly trained staff
undifferentiated product or service
poor stock management system
Opportunity
entering a young developing market
introduction of a government grant to increase consumption of your product (eg: solar power)
acquiring distribution rights for a complimentary product
Threat
new competitor entering your market
new regulations
increased trade barriers





Political environment
Consider the political environment for the areas that your business will trade and operate in.  Is there a stable political system?  Are there any licences and regulations that you should be aware of?  Do you need to win support to be able to operate?


3. Market Segmentation and Customer Analysis

Market segmentation
When you look closely at your market you’ll find that your consumers fall into different groups or ‘segments’.  Although all of your customers use your product or service they will value different aspects of it such as price, design, or ease of access.  You can segment your market by customers that have shared values.
For example, if you were selling electronic calculators your market could be segmented by how consumers use it eg: scientific, office, student and general use.  Each of these segments will have different requirements and may vary in price they are willing to pay.  
By understanding the needs of segment you can tailor your marketing mix to deliver what your customer values.  Each segment will offer growth and profit opportunities so the trick is to deliver the best offer to the best segment.
Target market/segment characteristics
You can profile your target market/segments using four categories:
Geographic:	eg: location, population size or climate.
Demographic: 	eg: age, gender, family size, family life cycle or income.
Psychographic:	eg: social class, lifestyle, motivation or personality.
Behavioural:	eg: product benefits, frequency of use or brand loyalty.

4. Objectives and Goals “Where the business needs to be”

Mission Statement
This is a statement of your businesses purpose, what you want to achieve.  Your mission statement should be market orientated.  For example Disney’s could be “We create happiness by providing the finest in entertainment for people of all ages.”

Objectives for volumes, sales, market shares, gross margins, net profit, return on investment
You mission is then broken down into achievable objectives.  Achieving each objective should take you a step closer to achieving your mission.  Working on the Disney example an objective could be “to be the most popular theme park for international visitors”.

Convert objectives to goals by assigning magnitudes and dates
Your goals outline how you are going to achieve your objectives.  They should be easy to measure and evaluate.  In our example a goal could be to: “increase market share of international theme park visitors by 10% in the next 2 years”.
