NOTICE TO PERSONS SUBJECT TO SUBPOENAS
Regardless of his or her county of residence, a witness subpoenaed for examination at a trial or hearing must be properly served with a
subpoena at least two days prior to the trial or hearing, or within a shorter time if the court so orders. The subpoena must be accompanied by a witness
fee calculated at the rate of $30.00 per day for attendance and $0.25 per mile for travel from the witness’ residence to the place of the trial or hearing.
Rule 45(d), Ark. R. Civ. P.
A witness subpoenaed in connection with a deposition must be properly served with a subpoena at least five business days prior to a
deposition, or within a shorter time if the court so orders. The witness is required to attend a deposition at any place within 100 miles of where he or
she resides, is employed, or transacts business in person, or at such other convenient place set by court order. The subpoena must be accompanied by
a witness fee calculated at the rate of $30.00 per day for attendance and $0.25 per mile for travel from the witness’ residence to the place of the
deposition. Rule 45(e), Ark. R. Civ. P.
A subpoena may command the person to whom it is directed to produce for inspection any books, papers, documents, or tangible things
designated in the subpoena. The person subpoenaed may ask the court to quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable or oppressive or to require
that the person on whose behalf the subpoena is issued pay the reasonable cost of such production. Rule 45(b), Ark. R. Civ. P. The person subpoenaed
may also object in writing to inspection or copying of any or all of the designated materials or seek a protective order from the court. If a written
objection is made within ten days of service of the subpoena or on or before the time specified for compliance if such time is less than ten days, the
party causing the subpoena to be issued is not entitled to inspect the materials unless the court so orders. Rule 45(e), Ark. R. Civ. P.
When a witness fails to attend in obedience to a subpoena or intentionally evades the service of a subpoena by concealment or otherwise,
the court may issue a warrant for arresting and bringing the witness before the court to give testimony and answer for contempt. Rule 45(g), Ark. R.
Civ. P.
