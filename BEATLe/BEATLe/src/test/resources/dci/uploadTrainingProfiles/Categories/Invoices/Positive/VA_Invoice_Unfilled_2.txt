invoice-template.html

Getting Started
                         Customize the template with
                         your company name, address,
                         and other contact
                         information. Then, save a
                         backup of the file to use as
                         a template for future
                         invoices.

                         For repeat customers, update
                         the Bill To section and
                         customer ID and save a backup
                         of the invoice to use as a
                         template for future invoices
                         to that specific customer.
                         You may want to name the file
                         something like &quot;Invoice
                         Template - Customer
                         Name.&quot;

                         Taxed
                         Place an &quot;x&quot; in the
                         Taxed column if the amount is
                         Taxable. The Taxable subtotal
                         is the sum of the amounts for
                         the items with an
                         &quot;x&quot; in the Taxed
                         column.

                         Other
                         Just above the Total, you
                         will see a field labeled
                         &quot;Other.&quot; This can
                         be changed to whatever you
                         want, such as
                         &quot;Shipping.&quot;

Sending an Invoice to a
Customer
                         One of the best ways to send
                         an invoice, besides printing
                         a paper copy and mailing it,
                         is to email the invoice as a
                         PDF attachment. You can
                         create a PDF with Excel by
                         exporting to PDF or going to
                         Save As and choosing PDF.
