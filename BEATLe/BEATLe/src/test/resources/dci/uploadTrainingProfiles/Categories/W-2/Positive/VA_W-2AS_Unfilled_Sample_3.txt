Notice to Employee
Do you have to file? Refer to the Form 1040 Instructions to determine if you are
required to file a tax return. Even if you do not have to file a tax return, you may be
eligible for a refund if box 2 shows an amount or if you are eligible for any credit.
Copies B and C; corrections. File Copy B of this form with your 2013 American
Samoa income tax return. Keep Copy C for your records. If your name, social
security number (SSN), or address is incorrect, correct Copies B and C and ask
your employer to correct your employment record. Be sure to ask your employer
to file Form W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, with the Social Security
Administration (SSA) to correct any name, amount, or SSN error reported to the
SSA. Be sure to get your copies of Form W-2c from your employer for all
corrections made so you may file them with your tax return.
Estimated tax. If you expect to owe $1,000 or more in tax (including selfemployment tax) for 2014, you may have to make estimated tax payments to the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Use Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals.
Clergy and religious workers. If you are not subject to social security and
Medicare taxes, see Pub. 517, Social Security and Other Information for Members
of the Clergy and Religious Workers.
Cost of employer-sponsored health coverage (if such cost is provided by the
employer). The reporting in box 12, using code DD, of the cost of employersponsored health coverage is for your information only. The amount reported
with code DD is not taxable.
Credit for excess social security tax. If you had more than one employer in 2013
and more than $7,049.40 in social security tax was withheld, you can have the
excess refunded by filing Form 843, Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement,
with the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service Center, Austin, TX
73301-0215, USA. However, if you are required to file Form 1040 with the United
States, you must claim the excess tax as a credit on Form 1040.
Unreported tip income. You must file Form 4137, Social Security and Medicare
Tax on Unreported Tip Income, with your income tax return to report at least the
allocated tip amount unless you can prove a smaller amount with adequate
records. If you have records that show the actual amount of tips you received,
report that amount even if it is more or less than the allocated tips. Use Form 4137
to figure the social security and Medicare tax owed on tips you did not report to

your employer. Enter this amount on the wages line of your tax return. (Form 1040SS filers, see the instructions for Form 1040-SS, Part I, line 5.) By filing this form,
your social security tips will be credited to your social security record (used to
figure your benefits).
(Also see the Instructions for Employee on this page and the back of Copy C.)

Instructions for Employee
(Also see Notice to Employee on this page.)
Box 5. This amount may be required to be entered on Form 8959. See Form 1040
instructions to determine if you are required to complete Form 8959.
Box 6. This amount includes the 1.45% Medicare Tax withheld on all Medicare
wages and tips shown in Box 5, as well as the 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax on
any of those Medicare wages and tips above $200,000.
Box 11. This amount is (a) reported in box 1 if it is a distribution made to you from
a nonqualified deferred compensation or nongovernmental section 457(b) plan or
(b) included in box 3 and/or 5 if it is a prior year deferral under a nonqualified or
section 457(b) plan that became taxable for social security and Medicare taxes this
year because there is no longer a substantial risk of forfeiture of your right to the
deferred amount. This box should not be used if you had a deferral and a
distribution in the same calendar year. If this happens and you are or will be age
62 by the end of the calendar year, your employer should file Form SSA-131 with
the Social Security Administration and give you a copy.
Box 12. The following list explains the codes shown in box 12. You may need this
information to complete your tax return. Elective deferrals (codes D, E, F, and S)
and designated Roth contributions (codes AA, BB, and EE) under all plans are
generally limited to a total of $17,500 ($12,000 if you have only SIMPLE plans;
$20,500 for section 403(b) plans if you qualify for the 15-year rule explained in
Pub. 571). Deferrals under code G are limited to $17,500. Deferrals under code H
are limited to $7,000.
However, if you were at least age 50 in 2013, your employer may have allowed
an additional deferral of up to $5,500 ($2,500 for section 401(k)(11) and 408(p)
SIMPLE plans). This additional deferral amount is not subject to the overall limit on
elective deferrals. For code G, the limit on elective deferrals may be higher for the
last 3 years before you reach retirement age. Contact your plan administrator for
more information. Amounts in excess of the overall elective deferral limit must be
included in income. See the “Wages, Salaries, Tips, etc.” line instructions for your
tax return.
