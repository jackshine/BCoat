During this term of fiscal year 2015, from January 1 to December 31, US economy which leads the world economy
has been showing moderate recovery since the beginning of this year continuously. Europe economy has been also
generally well. The world economy mainly developed countries have continued strong upturn over a year. On the
other hand, mainly China economy which shows remarkable slowdown behind a turmoil roiling stock markets and
emerging countries have been showing economic growth slowdown. In addition, there are the demands of the fall in
crude prices, a growing geopolitical risks, and the US Fed rate rise impacts. The world economy has been going
through variety of risk impacts to the second half of this year.
Under the government's various economic policies, Japan economy has been on a moderate recovery trend with a
corporate profits improving and a variety of healthy economic index. On the other hand, there are still concerns
such as world economy downward mainly due to China economic impact, Japan economy has still remain uncertainty.
In the worldwide Information Technology Industry, the worldwide PC shipments are continuously decreasing and
registering the highest decline growth rate from the same period in previous year. This record is mainly due to the
world economy impact with currency weakness in countries, etc.
On the other hand, cloud computing including
server virtualization and related services have been still leading to IT investments all over the world continuously.
The domestic PC shipments underrun from the same period in previous year due to several causes including recoil
reduction in the Windows XP replacement demand and new OS launch's minimal impact. These possibly caused
negative growth in this year domestic PC shipment. Meanwhile, domestic cooperate IT investments could be
expected to show positive yearly growth based on moderate recovery trend in Japan economy.
In the computer security industry, while "Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)" threats that pertain to computer
intrusions by threat actors that aggressively pursue and compromise chosen targets has plagued the entire world
continuously, cyber terrorism targeting specific companies or state institution, etc. which related to some cases of
identity theft in both business client information and personal private information have been also happened one
after another and remained high-visibility incidents at home and abroad. In addition, ransomware became a hot
topic in this year. This type of malware prevents or limits users from accessing their system to force its victims to
pay the ransom through certain online payment methods in order to grant access to their systems, or to get their
data back. From now on, there are concerns about various attacks to both devices and environments of Internet of

Things (IoT), as the framework to create new value through communication with one another by various gadgets and
devices on the networked connections, geopolitical terror attacks by hacktivists who use malicious techniques for
political or social reasons. In Japan, there is a national level concerning about personal information security due to
launch the “My Number” system since 2016. Those concerns will be expected to increase the security demands
for our future certainly.
Under such environment, our group business conditions are as follows:
With regards to sales in Japan region, despite the recoil reduction from strong PC sales due to the Windows XP
replacement demand in the same period in the previous year, consumer business has showed the growth with its
following rebates reduction. As for enterprise business sales, cloud related business has maintained its growth
continuously. In addition, APT related business starts to show its contribution to enterprise business sales. As a
result, net sales for this period in Japan region amounted to 52,599 million yen (3.7% increase from the same period
in the previous year.)
For North America region, consumer business sales have not still performed well with decrease in number of the
users. On the other hand, enterprise business, which maintained its sales growth and shows the continuous growth
of cloud related business, gives contribution for this region sales even in local currencies. In addition, with large
benefit by the weak Japanese yen, sales for this period in North America region was 29,325 million yen (17.5%
increase from the same period in previous year) which is also the region to have achieved the highest net sales
growth among the 5 sales regions with double-digit growth rate.
In EMEA region sales, especially APT related business shows significant growth. It leads to whole enterprise
business in this region with cloud related business. In spite of largely affected by the strong yen, sales for this
period in this region was 24,143 million yen (6.0% increase from the same period in previous year).
In the Asia Pacific region sales, mainly Australia, shows good condition in both local currency and Japanese yen
terms, has been leading in this region's sales with enterprise business including mainly cloud related business. As
a result, net sales for this period in Asia Pacific region amounted to 14,920 million yen (8.4% increase from the same
period in the previous year).
In Latin America region, both Brazil and Mexico have showed strong sales growth in local currencies in spite of the
strong yen impact. The enterprise business leads this region's sales mainly due to both cloud related businesses
and APT related businesses. As the result, net sales in this region registered double digit growth of 3,327 million
yen (11.6% increase from the same period in previous year).
As a result, the consolidated net sales for entire year of fiscal year 2015 amounted to 124,317 million yen (7.9%
increase from the same period in previous year), showing revenue growth in all region.
Cost of sales and operating expenses was largely affected by the weak Japanese yen overall. Especially people costs
which are the most affected by weak yen and virtual share bonus plan were increased. As a result, cost of sales and
operating expenses of 93,341 million yen (14.5% increase from the same period in previous year) and consolidated
operating income for this period was 30,976 million yen (8.0% decrease from the same period in the previous year).
In spite of a increase in gain on sale of marketable securities, etc. from the same period in previous year,
consolidated ordinary income for this period was 34,071 million yen (5.3% decrease from the same period in the
previous year) and the consolidated net income for this period was 21,435 million yen (3.9% decrease from the same
period in previous year).
(2) Qualitative Information on the Consolidated Earnings Forecast
Since the business environment surrounding Trend Micro Group tends to fluctuate in the short run, it is difficult to
make a highly reliable projection figures on a yearly basis. However, forecasts of net sales for FY 2016 was
assumed that Japan increases around a low single-digit percentage, North America region including TippingPoint
business increases by around 40% respectively, and Europe region increases around 5% from the same period in
previous year. In consideration of such a condition, we have decided to announce the earnings on an annually basis
in the fiscal year ending in December 2016 as followings.

[Overview of Cash Flow]
Cash flows from operating activity for this period were cash inflow of 30,490 million yen decreased
by 1,451 million yen compared with the previous period. This decrease of inflow was mainly due to the
increase balance of notes and accounts receivable.
Cash flows from investing activity were cash outflow of 4,926 million yen, decreased by 27,995
million yen compared with the previous period. This was mainly due to the decrease of payments for the
purchases of marketable securities and securities investments.
Cash flows from financing activity were cash outflow of 9,321 million yen decreased by 7,566 million
yen compared with the previous period. This decrease of outflow was mainly due to the increase of

“number of shares issued at the term end “(net of treasury shares).
*“Operating Cash Flow” is “Net cash flows from operating activities” in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
“Interest-bearing Debt” is all debts with interest payments among the debts reported in the consolidated balance sheet.
“Interest Payment” is the amount of payment for interest expense in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

(4) BASIC POLICY OF PROFIT SHARING
We intend to continue to return profits to shareholders based on the net profit on a consolidated basis while striving
to enhance financial strength and secure internal reserve in order to deal with significantly changing business
environment and maintain competitive edge against competitors.
As our basic policy on dividend, we plan to pay a year-end dividend on the basis of the dividend ratio of 70%.
Accordingly a year-end dividend on the basis of a dividend ratio of 70.3% of net income of 21,435 million yen in
FY2015, we have planned to pay total dividends of 15,060 million yen, which is 110 yen per share in this term.
We have a plan to pay dividend in next term based on our following mentioned policy on dividend.
As per to our announcement on October 21, 2015, “ Notice Subsidiary’s Execution of Asset Purchase Agreement
for Purchase of the TippingPoint Business of Hewlett-Packard Company,” we expect that this acquisition’s
amortization of goodwill will start from FY2016. To avoid the dividend payout being affected by this non cash charge,
we plan to pay the year-end dividend on the basis of a dividend ratio of 70% calculated after excluding the effect of
this acquisition related after-tax impact of the amortization of goodwill.
(Reported net income + After-tax impact of amortization of goodwill related to purchase of the TippoingPoint
Business) x 70%

(5) RISK FACTORS
The occurrence of any of the following risks could affect the Trend Micro group's business, financial condition, and
operating results. If this should happen, the trading price of shares of Trend Micro Incorporated, Trend Micro
group's parent company, could decline and its investors/shareholders could lose all or part of their investment.
Other risks and uncertainties unknown to us, the Trend Micro group, or that we, the Trend Micro Group, think are
immaterial may also impair our business.
1. MAJOR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE VENDORS MAY INCORPORATE ANTIVIRUS PROTECTION IN
THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WHICH COULD RENDER OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OBSOLETE OR
UNMARKETABLE.
There is a possibility of facing significant changes in the competitive environment, if major vendors of operating
system software and other software such as firewall, e-mail software or computer hardware, decide to enhance or
bundle their products to include antivirus and other computer security functions. These companies may offer
antivirus protection as a standard feature in their products, at minimal or no additional cost to customers, which

could render our wide range of products and services obsolete or unmarketable, particularly if antivirus products
offered by these vendors were comparable or superior to our wide range of products and services. In addition, even
if these vendors’ antivirus products offered fewer functions than our wide range of products and services, or were
less effective in detecting and cleaning virus-infected files, customers could still choose them over our wide range of
products and services due to lower cost or for any other reasons.
Currently, major software and hardware vendors have acquired several security vendors. If antivirus and other
computer security functions were to be included in those competitors’ products and services, this could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
2. AS WE GENERATE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SALES FROM A SINGLE SCOPE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE
VULNERABLE TO DECREASED DEMAND FOR SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.
Our main businesses focuses are our net sales from licensing and selling antivirus and other security products and
services. Although we have begun to offer more comprehensive network and internet security and management
software and services, we expect antivirus and other security products and services to continue to account for the
largest portion of our net sales in the foreseeable future. If the demand for, or the prices of, antivirus and other
security products and services drop as a result of competition, technological changes or other factors such as lower
growth or a contraction in the worldwide computer security market, this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
3. OUR WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY BECOME OBSOLETE BECAUSE RAPID
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES REGULARLY OCCUR IN THE COMPUTER SECURITY MARKET.
The computer security market is characterized by:
• rapid technological change;
• proliferation of new and changing computer viruses, malware programs, and threats over the internet;
• frequent product and services introductions and updates; and
• changing customer needs.
These characteristics of our market create significant risks and uncertainties for our business success. For example,
our competitors might introduce computer security products and services that are technologically superior to our
wide range of products and services. Additionally, new software operating systems, network systems or new
antivirus measurements or technologies could emerge. Emerging trends in these systems and standards currently
include applications distributed over the Internet and the use of a web browser to access client-server systems. Our
existing products and services might be incompatible with some or all of such standards. Our business, financial
condition and results of operations could materially suffer unless we are able to respond quickly and effectively to
these developments.
4. OUR HARDWARE-BASED PRODUCTS FACE MANUFACTURING AND INVENTORY RISKS.
We rely on a small number of third parties to manufacture some of our hardware-based products. We expect our
reliance on third-party manufacturers to become more important as the number of our hardware-based products
increases. Reliance on third-party manufacturers involves a number of risks, including a lack of control over the
manufacturing process and the potential absence or unavailability of adequate capacity. If any of our third-party
manufacturers cannot or will not manufacture our products in required quantities in compliance with environmental
and other regulations in the markets we serve, on a cost-effective basis, in a timely manner, or at all, we will have to
secure additional manufacturing capacity. The unexpected loss of any of our manufacturers could disrupt our
business. Furthermore, our hardware-based products contain critical components supplied by a single or a limited
number of third parties. Any significant shortage of components or the failure of the third-party supplier to
maintain or enhance these products could lead to cancellation of customer orders or delays in the placement of orders
and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.
5. WE MAY NOT GENERATE EXPECTED RESULTS WITH STRATEGIC ALLIANCES.
We are mainly focusing our business in the field of computer security business based on antivirus software.
Therefore, we actively pursue strategic alliances with other companies that allow us to provide customers with
integrated or other new products and services derived from the alliances. To launch and provide such products and
services, we may invest substantial cash and other resources in product development, marketing promotions and
support and maintenance activities. But we may not earn revenue successfully from alliances despite our efforts, and
such alliance may be terminated or dissolved due to various causes before generating revenue.
6. MARKET SHARE OF MAJOR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE VENDORS MAY PROVIDE COMPUTER
SECURITY FUNCTIONS FOR FREE COULD GROW.
The computer security industry which our group belongs to, has grown increasingly competitive. Our existing
competitors and other major vendors in the software and hardware industry etc. may start to offer antivirus and
other computer security functions for free or at very low prices. Those antivirus and other computer security

functions could be added into a single product, or bundled with their existing products. These companies may offer
antivirus protection as a standard feature in their products, at minimal or no additional cost to customers. This
could render our wide range of products and services to become obsolete or unmarketable, particularly if antivirus
products offered by these vendors were comparable or superior to our wide range of products and services. In
addition, even if these vendors’ antivirus products offered fewer functions or were less effective in detecting and
cleaning virus-infected files than our products and services, customers could still choose these venders due to the
lower cost.
In such a situation, our group’s business competitiveness could be inevitably weak, and it also has an adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
7. THE POSSIBILITY OF DECREASED SALES AND MARKET SHARE IN OUR CORE JAPANESE MARKET IF
OUR COMPETITORS ACHIEVE SUCCESS IN JAPAN.
Our major competitors are active in the Japanese antivirus software market and have allocated significant resources
to achieve success in the Japanese computer security market. Additionally, there have been not only existed
security venders as our direct competitors, but also new vendors joining by recent M&A or acquisition from other
industries and new entries, etc. Such a competition in our core Japanese market could intensify in the future if
other competitors emerge. As a result of our competitors’ efforts, we may not be able to maintain our current
leading market position in Japan in the future. Also, in order to respond effectively to increased competition, we
may be required to devote more of our product development, marketing and other resources to the Japanese market,
which could limit our ability to grow in other markets. A material loss of sales and market share in Japan as a
result of our competitors’ success could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.
8. AS WE MAY ACQUIRE COMPANIES TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, FUTURE ACQUISITIONS MAY REDUCE
OUR EARNINGS AND RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS IN OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.
In a rapidly changing industry, we occasionally review acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, we may seek to
expand our business through acquisitions. Unlike some of our major competitors, we have limited experience in
acquiring existing businesses. Future acquisitions could result in numerous risks and uncertainties, including:
• our inability to retain customers, suppliers and other important business relationships of an acquired business;
• difficulties in integrating an acquired company into Trend Micro, including the acquired company’s operations,
personnel, products and information systems;
• diversion of our management’s attention from other business concerns; and
• adverse effects on our results of operations arising from acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill and
purchased technology and possible recognition of impairment charge.
If we make such an acquisition using our stock, our current shareholders’ ownership interests will be diluted.
Any of these factors could materially hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations.
9. IF HACKERS / CRACKERS GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS, WE COULD SUFFER
DISRUPTIONS IN OUR BUSINESS AND LONG-TERM DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.
Our reputation may be more susceptible to problems than other software companies caused by hackers / crackers
trying to break into or attack our networks, steal secrets, and deface our site. As a computer security company that
delivers virus protection and other security products and services over the Internet, hackers / crackers specifically
target us in order to cause us to transmit computer viruses and malware programs, loss or theft of technical
information including the source codes etc., or vital information of customers or employees, and our groups’
website defacement over the internet. If these incidents occur, our group’s business could suffer. We could also
incur costs to fix technical problems or fix problems created by hackers gaining access to our proprietary information.
In addition, we could suffer substantial disruptions in our business and damage to our reputation which could result
in a significant loss of customers and other important business relationships until recovery of confidence.
10. WE FACE INFORMATION SECURITY RISKS RELATED TO INSIDERS / OFFICIALS IN OUR GROUP.
Our group has made contracts with subcontractors and employees with the purpose of preservation of confidentiality.
In the case of loss or theft of technical or private information for taking out and unfair use by our group insiders
despite taking legislative actions, etc., we could significantly discredit us. Additionally, there is also a possibility to
be brought an action for a large amount of damages. In such a case, we could suffer substantial disruptions in our
business and also incur costs to fix technical problems etc. and any of these factors could materially hurt our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
11. WE FACE NEW RISKS RELATED TO OUR ANTI-VIRUS AND OTHER SECURITY PRODUCTS AND
SERVICES.
A broad range of our security products may falsely identify emails, URLs, or programs as unwanted spam, malicious
web sites, and potentially dangerous programs. Our group’s security products and services may also fail to

properly identify and prevent unwanted emails, URLs, programs, malicious websites, or spyware that are often
designed to circumvent anti-virus, anti-spam, web filtering, or spyware products. Parties whose emails, URLs, or
programs are blocked by these our security products and services may seek redress against us for labeling them as
“ spammers, ” “ malicious websites, ” spyware, or for interfering with their business. In addition, false
identification of emails, URLs, or programs as unwanted “spam,” “malicious web sites” or “potentially
unwanted programs” may reduce the adoption of these products.
In addition, should we fail to properly test these products, solutions, or protection files and distribution a defective
file, vulnerabilities, etc., these could cause damage to customers. In such a case, it would adversely impact our
operating results and financial condition.
12. WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR BUSINESS GROWTH.
Our business field has been expanding. This expansion has placed, and any future business expansion or growth
would continue to place, a significant strain on our limited personnel, management and other resources. Our ability
to manage any future expansion or growth in our business will require us to:
• attract, train, retain, motivate and manage new employees successfully;
• effectively integrate new employees into our operations; and
• continue to improve our operational, financial, management and information systems and controls.
If we continue to expand or grow, our group’s management systems in place may be inadequate or we may not be
able to effectively manage our growth. In particular, we may be unable to:
• provide effective customer service;
• develop and deliver products in a timely manner;
• implement effective financial reporting and control systems; and
• exploit new market opportunities and effectively respond to competitive pressures.
13. WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH INTERMEDIARIES WHO MAY NOT VIGOROUSLY
MARKET OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OR MAY RETURN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.
We market substantially all of our products and services to end users through intermediaries, including distributors,
resellers and value-added resellers. Our distributors sell other products that are complementary to, or compete
with, our products and services. While we encourage our distributors to focus on our wide range of products and
services, these distributors may give greater priority to products of other suppliers, including competitors'. They
may also return the products to us under certain circumstances.
14. WEAK FINANCIAL CONDITIONS OF SOME OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
OPERATING RESULTS.
Some of our distributors are experiencing financial difficulties worldwide, which may adversely impact our collection
of accounts receivable. We regularly review the collectability and creditworthiness of our distributors to determine
an appropriate allowance for doubtful receivables. Our uncollectible accounts could exceed our current or future
allowance for doubtful receivables, which would be adversely significant impact our operating results.
15. OUR CUSTOMERS MAY CANCEL OR DELAY THEIR PURCHASES OF OUR WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS
AND SERVICES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.
Our wide range of products and services may be considered to be capital purchases by certain enterprise customers.
Capital purchases are often uncertain and, therefore, are canceled or delayed if the customer experiences a downturn
in its business prospects or as a result of unfavorable economic conditions. Any cancellation or delay could
adversely affect our results of operations.
16. WE RELY HEAVILY ON OUR MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL, WHO MAY NOT REMAIN
WITH US IN THE FUTURE.
We rely, and will continue to rely, on a number of key technical and management employees, including our Chief
Executive Officer, Eva Yi-Fen Chen. While we require our employees to sign employment agreements, our
employees are generally not otherwise subject to non-competition covenants. If any of our key employees leave, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.
17. THE MOBILITY OF HUMAN RESOURCES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE LABOR MARKET COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.
The computer security industry which our group belongs to, has grown increasingly competitive. In this
competitive environment, recruiting top-class human resources has been the most important challenges to support
innovative technology for all the companies.
Today, the majority of Trend Micro staff is based in Asia, as well as in the emerging countries. Due to this region's
rising inflation and costs of living, salaries will also have to increase. Any increase in costs caused by the above could
cause our group’s business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. Also the talent war with

competitors could adversely affect to our group's labor cost. Moreover, unexpected high turnover and recruitment
which does not work out as planned, may hurt our group's business performance.
If any of cost increase caused by those above, our group’s business, results of operations and financial condition
could suffer.
18. THE LOSS OF HUMAN RESOURCES INCLUDING MAJOR TECHNICAL SPECIALIST PERSONNEL
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.
The computer security industry which our group belongs to, has grown increasingly competitive. In this
competitive atmosphere, there is a possibility of human resources flow including major technical specialist personnel.
Our group has made contracts with all employees for the purpose of preservation of confidentiality and obligation not
to compete. Despite taking such legislative actions, we could suffer substantial disruptions in our business to our
reputation due to outflow of technical and strategic vital information, and other companies developing similar
technology with ours. In addition, our group’s business, operations and financial condition could suffer as a result
of the above.
19.FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD CAUSE THE MARKET PRICE OF
TREND MICRO INCORPORATED, TREND MICRO GROUP’S PARENT COMPANY, FOR ITS SHARES TO BE
VOLATILE.
We believe that our quarterly financial results may fluctuate in ways that do not reflect the long-term trend of our
future financial performance. It is likely that in some future quarterly periods, our operating results may be below
the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In this event, the share price of Trend Micro Incorporated,
Trend Micro group’s parent company, could fall.
Factors which could cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate include:
• timing of sales of our products and services to customers’ budgetary constraints, seasonal buying patterns and
our promotional activities;
• new product introductions by our competitors;
• significant marketing campaigns, research and development efforts, employee hiring, and other capital
expenditures by us to drive the growth of our business;
• changes in customer needs for antivirus and other computer securities; and
• changes in external environment including economic conditions in our major markets, etc.
20. FOREIGN EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS COULD LOWER OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BECAUSE WE
EARN REVENUES DENOMINATED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT CURRENCIES.
Our reporting currency is the Japanese yen and the functional currency of each of our subsidiaries is the currency of
the country in which the subsidiary is domiciled. However, a significant portion of our revenues and operating
expenses is denominated in currencies other than the Japanese yen, primarily the US dollar, Euro, and Asian
currencies. As a result, appreciation or depreciation in the value of other currencies as compared to the Japanese
yen could result in material transaction or translation gains or losses which could reduce our operating results.
These negative effects from currency fluctuations could become more significant if we are successful in increasing
our sales in markets outside of Japan.
Also, we have a portion of marketable securities for fund management. Those values will be affected by the ups and
downs of exchange rate denominated in foreign currencies and significant currency fluctuations could hurt our
corporate earnings significantly.
21. FINANCIAL MARKET FLUCTUATIONS COULD LOWER OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
We have marketable securities and security investments for efficient fund management. Those values of the capital
holdings will be affected by fluctuations in the financial market and exchange rates. In the future, if financial
market fluctuates widely, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations proportionate devaluation loss on investment in securities.
22. INFRINGEMENT OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD HURT OUR BUSINESS.
Our success depends on the development of proprietary software technology. We rely on a combination of
contractual rights and patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. Also, we made and entered NonDisclosure Agreement is into by and between employees and subcontractors to establish and protect proprietary
rights in our software. If we are unable to establish and protect these rights, our competitors may be able to use
our intellectual property to compete against us. This could limit our growth and hurt our business. It is possible
that no additional patents will be issued to us or any of our subsidiaries. In addition, our issued patents may not
prevent other companies from competing with us. On the other hand, there is the possibility of the suspension of
our products and services sales, compensation, and royalty payment of licensee because of our patent infringement
upon another company. Additionally, there is also a possibility that a case brought against a service invention and
suit filed by employee. In the case of losing such a lawsuit, payment to compensate the employee may be incurred.

23. THE POSSIBILITY OF FILE A SUIT BY PRODUCT AND SERVICE LIABILITY CLAIMS AND PRODUCT
RECALL.
Our group’s products and services are designed to protect customers’ network systems and personal computers
from damage caused by computer viruses, web threats and data stealing malware. As a result, if a customer suffers
damage from any of these threats or if the actual functions of our group's products and services differ from the stated,
the customers may return those products and also demanded refunds for services and the customer could sue us on
product liability or related grounds, claim damages for data loss or make other claims. Also, if our online file
storage service users suffer loss of data and information etc., caused by system troubles etc., the customer could sue
our group on product liability or related grounds, claim damages for data loss or make other claims. Additionally,
as threats are constantly evolving, purchasers of our software products must regularly update the software they
have purchased from us with signature protection files that we make available for download from our website.
Should we fail to properly test these protection files and distribute a defective file including vulnerabilities, these
files could cause damage to the personal computers, network environment, and various devices of our customers who
have downloaded a defective file. In addition, our hardware products as a defective appliance could cause damage
to human lives, health, and the personal property of our customers who have used a defective appliance. As a result,
if a customer suffers damage from our products, the customer could sue us on product liability or related grounds,
claim damages for data loss or make other claims. Otherwise, we could order a recall of products at the discretion
of company.
Our license agreements typically contain provisions, such as disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability,
which seek to limit our exposure to certain types of product liability claims. However, in some jurisdictions or
products recall cases these provisions may not be enforceable on statutory, public policy or other grounds. In the
case of losing such a law suit, there is a possibility that the case filed by our service and product users for damages
and recovery of pain and suffering damages could have a material adverse effect on our business.
24. OUR BUSINESS FACES THE RISK OF EFFECT FROM VIOLATION OR AMENDMENT OF THE LAW AND
THE LEGAL ACT.
All our business would be under various laws and regulations in each country and each region. If we would fail to
comply with those laws and regulations, it would provide more severe administrative guidance and penal regulations.
If officers and employees who are in our group violates the constitution or other laws or regulations, our group’s
business could suffer substantial disruptions in our business and to our reputation which could result in a loss of
customers and other important business relationships until recovery of confidence.
In such cases, there is the possibility to have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Also, in the case of
the laws and regulations legal amendments, there are the possibilities to be tightening regulations and restrictions
on our products and services and carry a cost in terms of relevant issues. In such a case, our business may have a
material adverse effect on our operating results.
25. OUR BUSINESS FACES THE RISK OF INTERRUPTION FROM POWER SHORTAGES, EARTHQUAKES
AND OTHER DISASTERS, OUTBREAK OF BIOLOGICAL VIRUSES, GEOPOLITICAL RISK, AND OTHER
HAZARDS.
Trend Micro group face a number of potential business interruption risks that are beyond our control. The State of
California experienced intermittent power shortages in 2000, sharp increases in the cost of energy and even
interruptions of service to some business customers. If power shortages continue to be a problem, our business may
be materially adversely affected. Or, in the outbreak of severe acute virus, influenza, or SARS, there is the
possibility that we should stop all our business operations.
Additionally, we may experience natural and biological disasters as like above that could interrupt our business.
The impact of nature disasters as a future major earthquake on our facilities, infrastructure and overall operations
is not known. There is no guarantee that nature disasters would not seriously disturb our entire business
operations. In addition, many of the key countries and regions in which we operate have sustained negative
economic impact from events such as the continued fear of future the outbreak of severe virus / acute respiratory
syndrome, etc., terrorist attacks and other geopolitical risks prolonged continuation of these adverse factors may
hurt our results of operations and financial condition.
26. THE STOCK PRICE OF TREND MICRO INCORPORATED, TREND MICRO GROUP’S PARENT COMPANY, IS
VOLATILE, AND INVESTORS BUYING THE SHARES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESELL THEM AT OR ABOVE
THEIR PURCHASE PRICE.
Shares of the common stock of Trend Micro Incorporated, Trend Micro group’s parent company, are traded on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. Recently, the Japanese securities markets have experienced significant price and volume
fluctuations. The market prices of securities of high-tech companies, and internet companies in particular, have
been especially volatile. Since trading in shares of Trend Micro Incorporated commenced on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange on August 17, 2000, stock price of Trend Micro Incorporated has fluctuated between a low of (Yen) 1,440

and a high of (Yen) 9,005. The closing price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for our stock on December 30, 2015 was
(Yen) 4,930. The market price of our shares is likely to fluctuate in the future.
27. BECAUSE OF DAILY PRICE RANGE LIMITATIONS UNDER JAPANESE STOCK EXCHANGE RULES, YOU
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR SHARES OF THE COMMON STOCK OF TREND MICRO INCORPORATED,
TREND MICRO GROUP’S PARENT COMPANY, AT A PARTICULAR PRICE ON ANY PARTICULAR TRADING
DAY, OR AT ALL.
Stock prices on Japanese stock exchanges are determined on a real-time basis by the equilibrium between bids and
offers. These exchanges are order-driven markets without specialists or market makers to guide price formation. To
prevent excessive volatility, these exchange set daily upward and downward price fluctuation limits for each stock,
based on the previous day’s closing price. Although transactions may continue at the upward or downward limit
price if the limit price is reached on a particular trading day, no transactions may take place outside these limits.
Consequently, an investor wishing to sell at a price above or below the relevant daily limit may not be able to sell his
or her shares at such price on a particular trading day, or at all.

3.【Management Policy】
(1) BASIC POLICY OF MANAGEMENT
Our Vision: A world safe for exchanging digital information.
Our Mission: Defend against threats that would impact user's digital life or IT infrastructure.

Computer networks, mainly those linked to the internet, have been a global infrastructure, as
lifelines of the information society regardless of individual, business or national border for a long
time.
Today, most threats on the network such as computer viruses, spyware, spam, site defacing, and
information theft cannot be predicted and completely prevented. In an increase of cyber-crimes which
cause theft of proprietary information, monetary damages, and malicious destructions no matter
enterprise or consumer, both users could be targeted and attacked. With Advanced Persistent Threat
(APT), which is popular attack technique, enterprise are targeted as a particular organization by

multi‐faceted attacks. At the same time, consumer users could be also targeted through those new IT
technologies and services including variable devices and services like smartphones, multi-functional
mobile devices such as tablets, etc., and SNS. Now more than ever, security is the breath of life to
enterprises and individuals.
Trend Micro's vision is to protect the global IT infrastructure including growing cloud computing. As
a company, we will provide globally-relevant products and services that cover multiple areas of
computer security including assessment, minimizing damages in an emergency, and restoration to against
sequence of cyber-attacks, mainly APTs. Trend Micro is not only protecting enterprises and individual
users from the threats over the networks without interrupting economic activities and usability, but
it is also contributing to the further development of the information society by improving the safety
of the whole network system.
(2). TARGET MANAGEMENT INDEX
According to a research institute, etc., the global Cyber Security market size that we belong to, is
estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8 percent from 2015 to 2020 (June 2015).
Making the growth rate of our consolidated net sales to exceed the industry average without fail is an
important index that tells us whether or not we can grow to become a leading company that can
contribute to customers both in the Japanese and the global market.
In view of the fact that we have a relatively small amount of investments in physical fixed assets
such as manufacturing equipment, have no significant time-lag between accounting profit and loss and
cash flows as a characteristics of software companies, and have uncertainty about the long-term
forecast of the whole industry which, including our company, has a relatively short history, we set
target as operating income margin rate of around 30 percent at this time.
(3). MID- TO LONG-TERM BUSINESS STRATEGY
Today, computers and the Internet are used by every person and in all types of scene and location in
every country across the world. It has been a part of our society and daily life for long time. In
addition to, not only the personal computers, but also smartphones and multi-functional mobile devices
such as tablets, etc., and other varied network devices have been launched. With this stream,
application programs and purposes of use have become diversified. As a result, there is no longer a
single solution that can protect against all the different type of threat environments. Also, in the
network environment, cloud computing, which has started actual use, creates innovation in digital
information traffic with easy, speedy, and reasonable for data mining and exchange to any information
including big data. Under such a situation, the competition in the computer security market has
changed, becoming more intensive with new entries.
And our group recognizes that these changes are business opportunities.
Recently, the rising use of cloud computing technology has been spurred by companies or organizations,
etc. from the perspective of business continuity planning and personal using diversifying mobile
devices. Thus, more has to be done to create new security for this cloud computing age. Trend Micro
group has been providing security solutions that belong to Trend Micro Smart Protection Network. These
include Cloud Computing Security Architecture and Deep Security for protection of mixed environments
of physical, virtual and cloud servers to protect data in cloud environments. We will provide security
products and services for virtualization and cloud environments, and not only traditional PC but also
any new internet devices which become diversified.
For accelerating digitalized business and society, and for protecting user's life, Trend Micro group
will strengthen further information security solution in the true digitalization framework to continue
to advance business relationships with our partners across boundaries between enterprise and consumer,
our group will keep working just as hard as ever to provide best solutions for not only variable ports
of each threat attack, but also diversified environments including physical environments, cloud
environments, and virtual environments. Moreover, we have a plan to offer comprehensive and great
certainty solutions in any breach detection.
For enhancing this strategy, our group signed a
definitive agreement with HP to acquire TippingPoint business including next-generation intrusion
prevention systems (NGIPS) and related network security solutions in 2015. In addition, for achieving
our vision: A world safe for exchanging digital information. As threat defense experts, our group will
advance as an innovative company with forefront of security technological development and provide
ongoing optimum solutions to protect the living environment of customers.
(4). ISSUES TO DEAL WITH
In the cyber security industry which our group belongs to, there have been not only existed security
venders as our direct competitors, but also new vendors joining by recent M&A or acquisition from
other industries and new entries, etc. They have been encouraging market competitions both domestic

and overseas. Such a consolidation and new entries are now too fluid to foresee the future direction
of this business and their presence in the computer security market will make the competition in the
market more intense.
In response to such intense competition, we are enhancing our wide range of technologies to better
combat the latest web threats, which evolve from day to day, through a number of acquisitions. With
those a series of acquisitions and organically grown technology, Trend Micro has taken the lead over
other competitors in creating cloud based security solution. Since 2009, Trend Micro Smart Protection
Network (SPN) is at the core of Trend Micro products and services.
In addition, we announced that a definitive agreement with HP to acquire TippingPoint business
including next-generation intrusion prevention systems (NGIPS) and related network security solutions
in 2015.
To combine SPN with their knowledge and technologies, we can offer higher value-added
security services and solutions to the market.
The past information society has been developed by digitalizing any mechanism including business
process and social structure human kind had created in the long history. Now, the Internet of Things
(IoT), as the framework to create new value through communication with one another by various gadgets
and devices on the networked connections, and digital technology such as mobile, cloud computing,
social media, and big data are predicated on future IT innovation.
Under this prediction, variable business models and new social structure will be developed from every
field as manufacturing, retail distribution industry, money and banking, service business, agriculture,
healthcare, and social-infrastructure, etc. in near future.
As the true digitalization progresses in the business field and the society, information security
risks also increase at an accelerated pace. As the property value of big data which enterprise has to
continue growing, the cybercrimes aim to it is increasing. It will be concerned the possibility of
emergence unprecedented cyber attacks by IoT, mobile, or cloud technology.
We will continue to concentrate management resources on developing original, high-performance
solutions that address customer pain points faster than the competitors. At the same time, we will
continue to pursue long-term growth with a stable financial foundation, strengthen our commitment to
users, as well as develop marketing campaigns that target customer needs and customer buying behavior.

4. 【Basic policy on the selection of accounting standards】
To secure comparability between companies and between fiscal years, Trend Micro group prepares its
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Japanese accounting standads. We will appropriately
consider application of IFRS (International Financial Report Standards) taking into condiseration of
condition in Japan and overseas.

(6) 【 Significant Accounting Policies and Practices for Preparing Consolidated Financial
Statements】
1

Basis of consolidation

2

Affiliated companies

3 Fiscal year of
consolidated subsidiaries
4 Accounting Policies
（1) Accounting for
evaluation of assets

(1) Consolidated subsidiaries
All of our 31 subsidiaries are consolidated.
Names of major subsidiaries:
Trend Micro Inc.
Trend Micro Incorporated
Trend Micro Australia Pty. Ltd.
Trend Micro (EMEA) Limited
(2) Unconsolidated subsidiaries
Broadweb Corporation (Brunei)
Itech Technology Limited(Brunei)
Broadweb Corporation
(Republic of Seychelles)
Broadweb Corporation (China)
Itech Technology Limited (China)
Equity method accounting is applied to investments in the following
affiliated companies.
*General Mobile Corporation (British Cayman islands)
*Anome Incorporated (Samoa)
*AsiaInfo Security Limited (China)
All financial statements included in a set of consolidated financial
statements are prepared as of the same date.
A. Marketable securities and investment securities

Available-for-sale with market value:
The securities are stated at the market value method based on the
value at the end of the period
(Unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in a separate
component of equity. Cost of selling is determined by the moving
average method.)

Available-for-sale without market value:
Cost basis by moving average method
The securities for investment fund and such funds, which are
recognized as marketable securities on Financial Instruments and
Exchange Law 2-2, are recognized the net ownership amount with the
latest available financial statements that is defined on the fund
contracts.

B. Inventories
Lower of cost or market by moving average method
The carrying value on the balance sheet of the inventory with lower
profit margin is written down

(2) Depreciation and
amortization

A. Property and equipment
Mainly, depreciation is computed by declining-balance method in
parent company and is computed by a straight-line method in
consolidated subsidiaries.
Useful lives of the main property and equipment are as follows :
Office furniture and equipment : 2– 20 years
B. Intangibles
a. Software for sale
Straight -line method over the estimated useful lives (12 months)
b. Software for internal use
Straight-line method over the estimated useful lives (mainly 5
years)
c. Other intangibles
Straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
C. Leased assets
Finance lease without transfer of ownership of the leased assets
Straight-line method in which the useful life is assumed to be the
lease period and the residual value is zero.

(3) Accounting policies for
allowances

A. Allowance for doubtful accounts
In order to reserve future losses from default of notes and account
receivable, allowance for bad debt is provided. The amount is
determined using the percentage based on actual doubtful account loss
against total of debts. As for high-risk receivables, expected
unrecoverable amount is considered individually.
B. Allowance for bonuses
Bonuses for employees are provided at an estimate of the amount.

(4) Accounting methods for
retirement
benefit
obligation

(5) Translation of foreign
currencies

C. Allowance for sales returns
In order to reserve future losses from sales return subsequent to
the fiscal year end, allowance for sales return is provided based on
the past experience in the sales return.
In calulating the retirement benefit obligation, the expected
retirement benefits are attributed to the periods by standard pension
benefit formula basis.
Actuarial gains and losses and past service costs are expensed in a
certain period less than average future service years of employees of
the year (1-23 years).
Foreign currency denominated receivables and payables are
translated into Japanese yen at period-end rates of exchange and the
resulting translation gains or losses are taken into current income.
All asset and liability accounts of foreign subsidiaries are
translated into Japanese yen at period-end rates of exchange and all
income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rate.
The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are included
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and minority
interest.

(6) Other important matters A. Consumption tax
for preparing
Transactions subject to consumption tax is stated at the amount net
financial statements
of the related consumption tax.

5

7

Valuation of assets and
liabilities of
consolidated
subsidiaries
Amortization of Goodwill

Definition of cash and
cash equivalent in the
consolidated statements
of cash flows

B. Revenue recognition method for Post Contract Customer Support
Service
Basically, the product license agreement contracted with the enduser states the article for
PCS (customer support and upgrading of products and its pattern
files).
The company applies the following revenue recognition method for the
portion of PCS. Portion of PCS revenue is recognized separately from
total revenue and is deferred as deferred revenues under current and
non-current liabilities based on the contracted period.
Deferred revenue is finally recognized as revenue evenly over the
contracted period.
Assets and liabilities of the consolidated subsidiaries
are measured at fair value.

Goodwill is amortized evenly over the appropriate period in less
than 20 years.
Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash
flows are composed of cash in hand, bank deposits able to be
withdrawn on demand and short-term investments with an original
maturity of three months or less and representing a minor risk of
fluctuations in value.

(7) 【Change of the Accounting Policy】

(Changes in accounting standard for retirement benefits)
The Company had adopted the paragraph 35 and paragraph 67 of "Accounting Standard for Retirement
Benefits" (ASBJ Statement No.26) and "Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits" (ASBJ
Guidance No.25) from this fiscal year.
Under the revised accounting standard, the Company has changed the method of calulating retirement
benefit obligations and service costs, with the method of determination of the discount rate revised to
a single weighted average discount rate reflecting the estimated timing and amount of benefit payment,
and the method of attributing benefits to accounting periods changed from the straight-line method to
the standard pension benefit formula basis.
As a result, the beginning balance of the retirement benefit obligation were decreased by JPY 147
million and the beginning balance of retained earnings were increased by JPY 95 million.
The effect to the consolidated statement of income is minor.

(8) 【Accounting Standard Not Yet Applied 】
(Accounting Standards for Business Combination)
On September 13, 2013, ASBJ issued "Revised Accounting Standard for Business Combinations" (ASBJ
Statement No.21) , "Revised Accounting Standard for Consolidated Financial Statements" (ASBJ Statement
No.22), "Revised Accounting Standard for Business Divestitures" (ASBJ Statement No.7), "Revised Accounting
Standsrd for Earnings Per Share" (ASBJ Statement No.2), "Revised Guidance on Accounting Standard for
Business Combinations and Accounting Standard for Business Divestitures" (ASBJ Guidance No.10), and
"Revised Guidance on Accounting Standard for Earnings Per Share" (ASBJ Guidance No.4).
Under these revised accounting standards, the accounting treatment for changes in a parent's ownership
interest in a subsidiary when that the parent retains control over the subsidiary in the additional acquisition of
shares in a subsidiary and acquisition related costs were revised. In addition, the presentation method of net
income was amended as well as the amendment of "minority interests" to "non-controlling interests," and
transitional provisions for accounting treatments were defined.
The Company expects to apply these revised accounting standards and guidance from the beginning of the

fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. However, the transitional provisions for accounting treatments will be
applied from business combinations performed on or after the beginning of the fiscal year ending December 31,
2016.
The effect of adoption of these revised accounting standards is now under assessment.
(Implementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets)
On December 28, 2015, ASBJ issued the Guidance No.26, Implementation Guidance on Recoverability of
Deferred Tax Assets.
The implementation guidance basically continues to apply the framework used in the JICPA No.66 where
recoveragility of deferred tax assets is assessed based on entities' categories, but certain acconting treatments
were changed. The changes include certain criteria for the entities' categories used for recoverability of deferred
tax assets and recoverability of deferred tax assets for unscheduled deductible temporary differences when
certain criteria are met.
The Comapny expects to apply the implementation guidance from the beginnign of the fiscal year ending
December 2017.
The effect of adoption of this implementation guidance is now under assessment.

accounting", "Financial instrument", "Derivative", "Stock Option", "Business combination" and "Investment
and Rental Property", because for the current fiscal year, the Company considers there is not a strong need
to release them.

【Footnote on going concern】

【Change of the Accounting Policy】
(Change in accounting standard for retirement benefits)
The Company had adopted "Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits" (ASBJ Statement No.26) and "Guidance
on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits" (ASBJ Guidance No.25) from this fiscal year.
Under the revised accounting standard, the Company has changed the method of calulating retirement benefit
obligations and service costs, with the method of determination of the discount rate revised to a single
weighted average discount rate reflecting the estimated timing and amount of benefit payment, and the method
of attributing benefits to accounting periods changed from the straight-line method to the standard pension
benefit formula basis.
As a result, the beginning balance of the retirement benefit obligation were decreased by JPY 147 million
and the beginning balance of retained earnings were increased by JPY 95 million.
The effect to the non-consolidated statement of income is minor.
