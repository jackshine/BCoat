Depending on where you live and your child's health, your doctor may recommend other shots. Talk to your doctor
about whether your child needs any of the following shots.
Age

Immunization

Notes
Your child may need this shot if he or she has not already had the vaccination
series and:

• Hepatitis A is found in your area.
• You and your child travel to countries with a high rate of hepatitis A. These

2 years
and older

include Mexico and countries in Central or South America, the Caribbean,
Asia (except Japan), Africa, and eastern Europe.
• Your child needs medicine to help the blood clot.
Hepatitis A (HepA)
Others at risk for hepatitis A include people who use "street" drugs, men
who have sex with men, and people who work with animals that have the
disease or who work with the hepatitis A virus in a lab. If your child has
contact with these groups of people, your child may also be at risk.
Two shots are given. The two shots must be at least 6 months apart.

Your child may need this pneumococcal shot when older than age 2 if he or
she:

2 years
and older

• Has sickle cell disease.
• Has a damaged spleen or has had the spleen removed.
• Has a disease or condition that affects the immune system, such as
Pneumococcal (PPSV)

diabetes or HIV.

• Takes medicine that affects the immune system, such as chemotherapy or
corticosteroids.
• Has a long-lasting disease, such as heart disease, lung disease, kidney
disease, or diabetes.

Your child may need this shot before age 11 if he or she:

6 weeks to
Meningococcal
10 years

• Is in an area where an outbreak has occurred.
• Has a damaged spleen or has had the spleen removed.

Missed doses: If your child has missed any shots, talk to your doctor about the best way to make them up.
Travel: If you are traveling or live outside of the United States, your child may need other shots. Talk to your doctor
several months before your trip.
Availability: Shots may sometimes not be available or may be in short supply. In this case, talk with your doctor
about the best thing to do for your child.
Reactions: List any reactions your child has had to vaccines.

Print out a copy of your child's schedule and keep it up to date. It is very important to keep accurate records of your
child's shots. When you enroll your child in day care or school, you may need to show proof of immunizations. Also,
your child may need the record later in life for college, employment, or travel. Take the schedule with you when you
visit your doctor. Your doctor may need to change the schedule based on your child's special needs. Keep the record
in a safe place with other important documents, and never throw it away. It is an important part of your child's lifelong
medical records.
Put notes on your calendar to remind you when a shot is coming up. You also may want to ask your doctor to send
you notices when shots are due.
This information is based on the immunization schedule recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) and other medical organizations. It is based on your child's birth date. The schedule is available from the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html.
Some diseases or treatments for disease affect the immune system. For children with these diseases or children receiving these
treatments, the schedule may need to be modified. Your child's health, environment, and lifestyle may also affect the shot
schedule. Always talk to your doctor about the best schedule for your child.
