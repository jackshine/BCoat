Defendant(s)
From The State of New Jersey To The Defendant(s) Named Above:
The plaintiff, named above, has filed a lawsuit against you in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint
attached to this summons states the basis for this lawsuit. If you dispute this complaint, you or your attorney must file a
written answer or motion and proof of service with the deputy clerk of the Superior Court in the county listed above within
35 days from the date you received this summons, not counting the date you received it. (A directory of the addresses of
each deputy clerk of the Superior Court is available in the Civil Division Management Office in the county listed above and
online at http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/pro se/10153_deptyclerklawref.pdf.) If the complaint is one in foreclosure, then
you must file your written answer or motion and proof of service with the Clerk of the Superior Court, Hughes Justice
Complex, P.O. Box 971, Trenton, NJ 08625-0971. A filing fee payable to the Treasurer, State of New Jersey and a
completed Case Information Statement (available from the deputy clerk of the Superior Court) must accompany your
answer or motion when it is filed. You must also send a copy of your answer or motion to plaintiff's attorney whose name
and address appear above, or to plaintiff, if no attorney is named above. A telephone call will not protect your rights; you
must file and serve a written answer or motion (with fee of $175.00 and completed Case Information Statement) if you
want the court to hear your defense.
If you do not file and serve a written answer or motion within 35 days, the court may enter a judgment against you for
the relief plaintiff demands, plus interest and costs of suit. If judgment is entered against you, the Sheriff may seize your
money, wages or property to pay all or part of the judgment.
If you cannot afford an attorney, you may call the Legal Services office in the county where you live or the Legal
Services of New Jersey Statewide Hotline at 1-888-LSNJ-LAW (1-888-576-5529). If you do not have an attorney and are
not eligible for free legal assistance, you may obtain a referral to an attorney by calling one of the Lawyer Referral
Services. A directory with contact information for local Legal Services Offices and Lawyer Referral Services is available
in the Civil Division Management Office in the county listed above and online at
http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/prose/10153_deptyclerklawref.pdf.
