other remedy, use the Security Deposit to the extent necessary to make good any arrearages of
rent or to satisfy any other covenant or obligation of Tenant hereunder. Following any such
application of the Security Deposit, Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand the amount so
applied in order to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount. If Tenant is not in default at
