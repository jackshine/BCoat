About this Loan
• You are applying for a reverse mortgage loan on your home that you do not have to repay for as long as you
live there.
• You may get money from this loan paid to you all at once, as a regular monthly advance, or at times and in
amounts that you choose.
• You will continue to own your home so you must pay your property taxes and insurance, and keep the home
in good repair (see the Risks section).
• If the loan balance eventually is greater than the value of the home, you will continue to receive monthly
payments and have access to your loan funds as long as you remain in the home.
• The amount of the loan, plus interest and fees, must be paid back in full if the home is sold or when the last
surviving borrower dies or does not live in the house for 12 consecutive months.

• Failing to meet any other obligation

more money from your line of credit, even if you have borrowed less
than your credit limit.

We may terminate your loan, make you pay the outstanding loan
balance in one payment, and charge you fees on termination.

We may also make other changes to your loan.
