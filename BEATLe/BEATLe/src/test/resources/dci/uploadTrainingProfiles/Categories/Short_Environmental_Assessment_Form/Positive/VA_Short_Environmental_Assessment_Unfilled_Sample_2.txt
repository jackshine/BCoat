PART III - DETERMINATION OF SIGNIFICANCE (To be completed by Agency)
INSTRUCTIONS: For each adverse effect identified above, determine whether it is substantial, large, important or otherwise significant. Each effect
should be assessed in connection with its (a) setting (i.e. urban or rural); (b) probability of occurring; (c) duration; (d) irreversibility; (e) geographic
scope; and (f) magnitude. If necessary, add attachments or reference supporting materials. Ensure that explanations contain sufficient detail to show
that all relevant adverse impacts have been identified and adequately addressed. If question d of part ii was checked yes, the determination of
significance must evaluate the potential impact of the proposed action on the environmental characteristics of the CEA.
Check this box if you have identified one or more potentially large or significant adverse impacts which MAY occur. Then proceed directly to the
FULL EAF and/or prepare a positive declaration.
Check this box if you have determined, based on the information and analysis above and any supporting documentation, that the proposed action
WILL NOT result in any significant adverse environmental impacts AND provide, on attachments as necessary, the reasons supporting this
determination.
