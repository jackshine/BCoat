   All employers must conduct a risk assessment. If you have fewer than five employees you don't have to write anything down.

We have started off the risk assessment for you by including a sample entry for a common hazard to illustrate what is expected (the sample entry is taken from an office-based business).                                  Look at how this might apply to your business, continue by identifying the hazards that are the real priorities in your case and complete the table to suit.                                                                                You can print and save this template so you can easily review and update the information as and when required. You may find our example risk assessments a useful guide (http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/casestudies). Simply choose the example closest to your business.
