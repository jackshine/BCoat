REQUEST FOR AND AUTHORIZATION TO RELEASE MEDICAL
RECORDS OR HEALTH INFORMATION
Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Information: The execution of this form does not authorize the release of information other than that specifically described below. The
information requested on this form is solicited under Title 38, U.S.C. The form authorizes release of information in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 45
CFR Parts 160 and 164, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and 38 U.S.C. 5701 and 7332 that you specify. Your disclosure of the information requested on this form is voluntary. However, if the information
including Social Security Number (SSN) (the SSN will be used to locate records for release) is not furnished completely and accurately, Department of Veterans Affairs will be unable to
comply with the request. The Veterans Health Administration may not condition treatment, payment, enrollment or eligibility on signing the authorization. VA may disclose the information
that you put on the form as permitted by law. VA may make a "routine use" disclosure of the information as outlined in the Privacy Act systems of records notices identified as 24VA10P2
“Patient Medical Record - VA” and in accordance with the Notice of Privacy Practices. You do not have to provide the information to VA, but if you don't, VA will be unable to process your
request and serve your medical needs. Failure to furnish the information will not have any affect on any other benefits to which you may be entitled. If you provide VA your Social Security
Number, VA will use it to administer your VA benefits. VA may also use this information to identify veterans and persons claiming or receiving VA benefits and their records, and for other
purposes authorized or required by law. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires us to notify you that this information collection is in accordance with the clearance requirements of
section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. We may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid OMB
number. We anticipate that the time expended by all individuals who must complete this form will average 2 minutes. This includes the time it will take to read instructions, gather the
necessary facts and fill out the form.
