[Revenue]
Consolidated revenue was ¥1,777.8 billion, an increase of ¥86.1 billion (+5.1%) compared to the previous year.
-

In Japan, the sales of AZILVA (a drug for hypertension) and LOTRIGA (a drug for hyperlipidemia)
significantly increased over the previous year. In the U.S., in addition to the increase in sales of VELCADE
(a drug for multiple myeloma), ENTYVIO (a drug for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease) has
experienced an outstanding sales uptake since its launch in 2014. Furthermore, the sales of ADCETRIS (a
drug for lymphoma) continued to expand in Europe, and the depreciation of the yen also had a positive
impact on revenue. On the other hand, there were also negative factors, including the penetration of generic
products after the patent expiry of blockbuster products such as candesartan (Japan product name:
BLOPRESS, a drug for hypertension) and lansoprazole (Japan product name: TAKEPRON, a drug for
peptic ulcers), and the impact of the National Health Insurance price reduction in Japan.
In total, consolidated revenue increased by ¥86.1 billion.
Underlying revenue growth* increased by 2.8% compared to the previous year.
* Underlying revenue growth: Constant currency and without divestments

[Operating profit]
Consolidated operating loss was (¥129.3) billion, a decrease of ¥268.5 billion (-192.8%) compared to the
previous year.
- Gross profit increased by ¥55.4 billion (+4.6%) due to revenue increase.
- Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by ¥56.4 billion (+10.1%) mainly due to the launch of
new products in the U.S.
- R&D expenses increased by ¥40.5 billion (+11.9%) to ¥382.1 billion compared to the previous year.
- Amortization and impairment losses on intangible assets associated with products increased due to
recognition of impairment loss for a product of ¥53.2 billion.
- Other operating income significantly increased mainly due to the reversal of a contingent consideration
(Note) that varies with performance of the COLCRYS business of ¥53.8 billion and the gains on sales of
property, plant and equipment of ¥32.8 billion.
(Note) A fair value liability of estimated additional consideration based on future specific events to transfer to
former owners of an acquired company.
- The company and its subsidiaries in the U.S. have reached agreement expected to resolve the vast majority of
pioglitazone (U.S. brand name: ACTOS) product liability lawsuits pending in the U.S. against Takeda.
Accordingly, Takeda recognized the provision of $2.7 billion (¥324.1 billion) for covering the settlement, for
costs associated with court cases against plaintiffs who do not participate in the settlement, and for other
related expenses. Takeda also recognized the insurance receivable of ¥50.0 billion which is anticipated to be
covered by product liability insurance. In total, the net amount was booked as other operating expense.
- On an underlying basis, which excludes FX impacts and other factors, selling, general and administrative
expenses increased by 5.4% (general and administrative expenses, excluding selling expenses, decreased by
0.7%) and R&D expenses increased by 1.0%.

[Net profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company)]
Consolidated net loss for the year was (¥145.8) billion, a decrease of 252.4 billion (-236.7%) compared to the
previous year.
-

In addition to the decrease in operating profit, net financial income/expenses decreased mainly due to the
decrease in gains on sales of financial assets compared to the previous year. Furthermore, tax expenses
increased due to revaluation of a recoverability of deferred tax assets and a reduction of the effective tax rate
in Japan. As a result, consolidated net profit for the year significantly decreased.
- Basic earnings per share was (¥185.37), a decrease of ¥320.47 (-237.2%) compared to the previous year.
[Core Earnings]
Core Earnings was ¥288.3 billion, a decrease of ¥25.9 billion (-8.2%) compared to the previous year.
-

Core Net Profit* was ¥176.7 billion, a decrease of ¥33.5 billion (-15.9%) compared to the previous year.
Core EPS was ¥224.73, a decrease of ¥41.52 (-15.6%) compared to the previous year.
* Core Net Profit is calculated by deducting any temporary factors such as impacts from business combination
accounting and amortization/impairment losses of intangible assets etc. and tax effects on them from Net profit
for the year.

Details of major commercial initiatives during the reporting period, divided by therapeutic area, are as follows.
For the details of R&D activities, please refer to section “Activities and Results of Research & Development”
on page 8.

Gastroenterology (GI)


In June 2014, Takeda launched ENTYVIO in the U.S. and Europe for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and
Crohn’s disease. ENTYVIO is a groundbreaking new product that offers a new treatment option to patients
with inflammatory bowel disease who have failed to respond to treatment with existing products, and it is
anticipated to be a blockbuster global product for Takeda.



In October 2014, Takeda entered into a global license, development, commercialization and supply
agreement for lubiprostone (U.S. product name: AMITIZA) with Sucampo Pharmaceuticals. Through this
agreement, Takeda expanded its exclusive rights beyond the US and Canada to all global markets, except
Japan and China.



In February 2015, Takeda launched TAKECAB in Japan in co-promotion with Otsuka Pharmaceutical
Company, Limited. TAKECAB is a new drug discovered and developed by Takeda that provides a fastacting, strong and sustained effect for treating acid-related diseases.

Oncology


In April 2014, Takeda launched ADCETRIS in Japan for the treatment of malignant lymphomas, a highly
anticipated new treatment option for patients. Takeda is steadily increasing the number of countries where
this treatment is available, including emerging markets.



Multiple myeloma treatment VELCADE has grown to become Takeda's top selling product in FY2014.

Central Nervous System (CNS)


Takeda is now focusing on achieving swift market penetration to quickly maximize the value of
BRINTELLIX, a treatment for major depressive disorder. BRINTELLIX was in-licensed from Lundbeck
and launched in 2014 in the U.S.

Cardiovascular and Metabolic (CVM)


In June 2014, Takeda launched ZACRAS in Japan (a fixed-dose combination of anti-hypertensive
treatment AZILVA and the calcium channel blocker amlodipine), a treatment for hypertension that is
anticipated to provide a strong and sustained anti-hypertensive effect, improving control of blood pressure
levels.



In October 2014, Takeda launched CONTRAVE in the United States as a new treatment option for obesity.
CONTRAVE was in-licensed from Orexigen.

Revenue in the Ethical Drug Business was ¥1,614.5 billion, an increase of ¥85.4 billion (+5.6%) compared to
the previous year, and operating loss was (¥178.9) billion, a decrease of ¥291.0 billion (-259.6%) compared to
the previous year.
-

Revenue in Japan was ¥561.3 billion, a decrease of ¥20.8 billion (-3.6%) compared to the previous year.
Contribution from sales increase of products launched in and after 2010 such as AZILVA, LOTRIGA and
NESINA could not fully absorb the decrease in sales mainly due to the National Health Insurance price
reduction and the penetration of generic products.

Revenue in overseas markets was ¥1,053.2 billion, an increase of ¥106.2 billion (+11.2%) compared to the
previous year. In addition to the sales increase of VELCADE and DEXILANT in the U.S., contribution
from new products such as BRINTELLIX and ENTYVIO, and the yen's depreciation could fully absorb the

[Consumer Healthcare Business]
Revenue in the Consumer Healthcare Business was ¥73.6 billion, an increase of ¥0.7 billion (+1.0%) compared
to the previous year, mainly due to the increase in sales of ALINAMIN tablets (vitamin-containing products).
Operating profit increased by ¥0.8 billion (+4.9%) to ¥17.2 billion mainly due to the improvement in gross
profit margin.
[Other Business]
Revenue in the Other Business remained relatively flat compared to the previous year at ¥89.7 billion. Operating
profit increased by ¥21.7 billion (+200.7%) to ¥32.4 billion mainly due to the gains on sales of property, plant
and equipment.

(iii) Activities and Results of Research & Development
Takeda has aligned its research and development functions into the four Therapeutic Area Units (TAUs) of
Central Nervous System, Cardiovascular/Metabolic, Gastroenterology, and Oncology, to further promote
therapeutic area and asset strategies to achieve a global leadership position in each area, and to meet the unmet
medical needs of patients. In addition, Specialty Business Units have been established for Oncology and
Vaccines, which include operational and commercial functions.
Major events from R&D activities during the reporting period are as follows;

[In-house R&D activities]
- In May 2014, Takeda received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ENTYVIO
(generic name: vedolizumab) for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). Also in
May 2014, Takeda received approval from the European Commission (EC) for ENTYVIO.
- In May 2014, Takeda received approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW)
for an application for changes to the indication of type 2 diabetes treatment NESINA (generic name:
alogliptin). The newly approved indication is "Type 2 Diabetes", which includes the previously unapproved
indication of concomitant therapy with a rapid-acting insulin-secretion stimulating agent. The "Type 2
Diabetes" indication now allows concomitant therapy of NESINA with all the oral anti-diabetic agents and
insulin.
In March 2015, a post hoc analysis of data from EXAMINE, a global cardiovascular safety outcomes trial of
alogliptin, was published in The Lancet. In April 2015, the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory
Committee (EMDAC) of the FDA convened to review EXAMINE and voted that the use of alogliptin in
patients with Type 2 diabetes has an acceptable CV risk profile.
- In May 2014, Takeda presented the results of five Phase III trials for TAKECAB (generic name: vonoprazan),

[Revenue]
Consolidated revenue is expected to increase from the previous year. The sales decrease of leading products
such as Candesartan and Lansoprazole will be absorbed by the growth of new products such as ENTYVIO in
the U.S. and AZILVA in Japan, sales expansion in emerging markets, and the positive influence of exchange
rate assumptions.
[Operating profit]
Consolidated operating profit is expected to significantly increase from the previous year. Despite an increase in
expenses related to the launches of new products and the redesign of the global organizational structure, and the
gains on sales of unused real estate is not planned in this year, R&D expenses are forecast to decline, and the
previous year was negatively impacted by expenses related to ACTOS lawsuits in the U.S.
[Net profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company)]
Consolidated net profit for the year is expected to significantly increase from the previous year. In addition to
the increase in operating profit, the previous year was negatively impacted by a temporary increase in tax
expenses due to the revaluation of recoverability of deferred tax assets and a reduction of the effective tax rate
in Japan.
[Assumptions used in preparing the Outlook]
The foreign exchange rates assumptions for fiscal 2015 are US$1 = ¥120 and 1 Euro = ¥130.
[Forward looking statement]
All forecasts in this document are based on information currently available to the management, and do not
represent a promise or guarantee to achieve those forecasts. Various uncertain factors could cause actual results
to differ, such as changes in the business environment and fluctuation of foreign exchange rates. If a significant
event occurs that requires the forecasts to be revised, the Company will disclose it in a timely manner.

(2) Analysis of Consolidated Financial Position
[Assets]
Total assets as of March 31, 2015 were ¥4,296.2 billion, a decrease of ¥273.0 billion compared to the previous
fiscal year end.
In addition to the decrease in intangible assets due to the depreciation and impairment loss, other financial assets
(current) decreased resulting from the redemption of bonds.
On the other hand, the company and its subsidiaries in U.S. are most likely to reach agreement to resolve the
vast majority of ACTOS product liability lawsuits pending against Takeda. Accordingly, other financial assets
(current) increased due to the insurance income which will be probably covered by the product liability
insurance.
[Liabilities]
Total liabilities as of March 31, 2015, were ¥2,090.0 billion. Despite the redemption of bonds, total liabilities
increased by ¥61.5 billion from the previous fiscal year end due to the provision made for the Actos litigation
that includes settlement costs, legal fees and other associated costs that totaled ¥324.1 billion.
[Equity]
Total equity decreased by ¥334.5 billion from the previous fiscal year end to ¥2,206.2 billion as of March 31,
2015, due to the significant net loss recorded for the year, in addition to dividend payments.
The ratio of equity attributable to owners of the Company to total assets decreased by 4.3 pt. to 49.7% from the
previous fiscal year end.
[Cash Flows]
Cash flow for the current fiscal year resulted in a net cash outflow of ¥10.8 billion.
Net cash inflow by operating activities was ¥182.5 billion, net cash inflow by investing activities was ¥91.3
billion, and net cash outflow by financing activities was ¥301.0 billion mainly due to redemption of bonds.

(3) Basic Policy for Profit Distribution and Dividends for Fiscal 2014 and 2015
(i) Basic Policy for Profit Distribution
In order to maximize the enterprise value of Takeda, we strive towards a sustainable improvement in earning
capacity through essential investment in R&D and the steady implementation of our growth strategies. In
addition, we are maintaining and strengthening our sound financial base under a flexible financial strategy,
working to improve the efficiency of working capital through the optimization of the balance sheet and
allocating generated free cash flow into investments for sustainable growth and the repayment of debt.
Regarding the distribution of profits resulting from our sustainable increase in profitability, in fiscal year
2015 we will maintain the annual dividend of 180 yen per share. Moving forward, with an emphasis on
return to shareholders, we strive to at least maintain the 180 yen annual dividend per share after fiscal year
2015.
(ii) Dividend for Fiscal 2014
Takeda plans to pay a year-end dividend of ¥90 per share. This, together with the dividend at the end of
second quarter of ¥90 already paid, will achieve an annual dividend of ¥180 for the year ended March 31,
2015, which is the same amount as last year.
(iii) Dividend for Fiscal 2015
For the next fiscal year, Takeda plans to pay an annual dividend of ¥180 per share, a same amount as fiscal
year 2014.

(4) Risk Factors in Business
Takeda’s business performance is subject to various present and future risks, and may experience unexpected
fluctuations due to the occurrence of risk events. Below is a discussion of the main assumed risks that Takeda
faces in its business activities. Takeda works to fully identify potential risks and takes all possible steps to
prevent them from materializing. Moreover, Takeda will ensure a precise response if risk events occur.
The future events contained in these items are envisioned as of the end of fiscal 2014.
(i) Risk in R&D
While Takeda strives for efficient R&D activities aimed at launching new products in each market of Japan,
the United States, Europe and Asia as early as possible, marketing of ethical drugs, whether in-house
developed or licensed compounds, is allowed only when they have been approved through rigorous
investigations of efficacy and safety as stipulated by the competent authorities.
If the efficacy and safety of compounds Takeda is preparing to bring to market do not meet the required level
for approval, or if the reviewing authorities express concern regarding the conformity of such compounds,
Takeda will have to give up R&D activities for such compounds at that point, or conduct additional clinical
or non-clinical testing. As a result, Takeda risks the inability to recoup the costs incurred, a delay in
launching new products, or being obliged to revise its R&D strategy.

- 14 -

Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (4502)
Consolidated Financial Statements for Fiscal 2014

(ii) Risk in intellectual property rights
Each of Takeda’s products is protected for a certain period by various patents covering substance, processes,
formulations and uses.
While Takeda strictly manages intellectual property rights, including patents, and always keeps careful watch
for potential infringement by a third party, expected earnings may be lost if the intellectual property rights
held by Takeda are infringed by a third party. Moreover, if Takeda’s in-house product is proven to have
infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights, Takeda may be required to pay compensations.
(iii) Risk of sales decrease following patent expirations
While Takeda takes active measures to extend product life cycles, including the addition of new indications
and formulations, generic drugs inevitably penetrate the market following patent expirations of most branded
products. In addition, the increasing use of generic drugs and prescription-to-OTC switches also intensifies
competition, both in domestic and overseas markets, especially in the U.S. market. Takeda’s sales of ethical
drugs may drop sharply as a result of these trends.
(iv) Risk of side effects
Although ethical drugs are only allowed to be marketed after approval for production and marketing
following rigorous investigation by the competent authorities around the world, accumulated data during the
post-marketing period may reveal side effects that were not known at the time of launch. If new side effects
are identified for a product, Takeda will be required to describe the side effects in a “precaution” section of
the package insert, or restrict usage of the product. Takeda may also be obliged to either discontinue sale of
the product or recall it. The company can potentially be liable for damages and liabilities if such events
occur.
(v) Risk of price-reduction due to movements to curtail drug costs
In the U.S. market, which is the world’s largest, authorities are promoting the use of low-price generic drugs,
and pressure to reduce brand drug prices is increasing as a result of strong demand from the federal and state
governments and Managed Care programs. In Japan, authorities have been reducing National Health
Insurance (NHI) prices for drugs every other year and are also promoting the use of generic drugs. In the
European market, drug prices have been reduced in a similar fashion, due to measures implemented in each
country to control drug costs and the expansion of parallel imports. Price reduction as a result of efforts to
curtail drug costs in each country can significantly influence the business performance and financial standing
of the Takeda Group.
(vi) Influence of exchange fluctuations
The Takeda Group’s overseas revenue in fiscal 2014 amounted to ¥1,065.0 billion, which accounted for
59.9% of total consolidated revenue. Revenue in the U.S. was ¥426.1 billion, which accounted for 24.0% of
total consolidated revenue. For this reason, the Takeda Group’s business performance and financial standing
are considerably affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Most of such risks are pure translation
risks and as such cannot be mitigated.

- 15 -

Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (4502)
Consolidated Financial Statements for Fiscal 2014

(vii) Risk related to Corporate Acquisitions
As part of its global business development in order to realize sustainable growth, Takeda engages in
corporate acquisitions. However, there is a possibility that the intended result or profit expected from such
acquisitions may not be realized, as business activities in countries around the world are confronted by many
risks including, but not limited to, changes in law and regulations, political unrest, economic uncertainty and
differences in business practices. In addition, there may be an impact on the financial results and financial
condition of Takeda if write-downs etc. occur due to a decrease in the value of acquired assets resulting from
investment activities such as corporate acquisitions.
(viii) Country risk in the countries and regions in operation
With developing its business globally, Takeda establishes its risk management structure to reduce the damage
from and cope with the risks, including governmental, social and economic risks in the countries and regions
in operation. However, Takeda may face unexpected situations. As a result, there may be an impact on the
financial results and financial condition of Takeda.
(ix) Risk related to stable supply
In parallel with rapid international expansion of its sales network, Takeda is strengthening its global supply
chain. However, in the event of technical or legal / regulatory problems in Takeda’s production or
distribution facilities, or other disruption due to natural disasters or accidental reasons, Takeda may have a
suspension of or substantial delay in the supply of products. As a result, there may be an impact on the
financial results and financial condition of Takeda.
(x) Risk related to litigation and other legal matters
Regarding to Takeda's operational activities, in addition to the existing litigations, there is a possibility that a
suit may be brought to court in terms of an adverse effect of pharmaceutical product, product liability, labor
issues, fair trade, etc. As a result, there may be an impact on the financial results and financial condition of
Takeda.

3. Management Policy
(Basic Management Policy)
Takeda places “Takeda-ism” (Integrity: Fairness, Honesty and Perseverance) at the heart of all its activities,
with a deliberate focus, by order of priority, on the well-being of patients, the reinforcement of trust with
society, its reputation and business performance.
As a research driven pharmaceutical company, Takeda aims to realize its Mission of “striving towards better
health for people worldwide through leading innovation in medicine”, which has been summarized in the tagline
“Better Health, Brighter Future”.
Takeda is patient and customer centric, and with a global organization fostering talent, a focused world class
innovation engine, and attention to financial discipline, Takeda strives to be a best-in-class, agile company with
sustainable, profitable growth in the years ahead.

(Medium to Long Term Management Strategy and Issues to be Addressed)
Fiscal Year 2014 was a pivotal year for the transformation of Takeda, with the successful launches of several
new products including ENTYVIO for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and TAKECAB for acid-related
diseases, a redesign of its global organizational structure, and the progressive implementation of business
process innovation. In the first two years of execution, Project Summit has already achieved more than half of
its five-year (2013-2017) cost savings target of 120 billion yen.
These achievements have laid the foundation for Takeda to enter the next important phase of strategic execution
from Fiscal Year 2015. Takeda expects organic revenue growth in the mid-term period, with its main growth
drivers being Innovative Products in the United States and Value Brands (branded generics and OTC products)
in Emerging Markets.
Over the next few years, ENTYVIO is expected to be a key contributor to sales growth, along with other
recently launched products including TAKECAB, AZILVA for the treatment of hypertension, ZAFATEK for
type 2 diabetes, BRINTELLIX for major depressive disorder and CONTRAVE for obesity, with later growth
coming from pipeline assets including ixazomib for multiple myeloma. Takeda is facing some challenges,
especially in 2015, such as increased generic penetration in Japan, but the company will realize profitable
growth and creation of shareholder value through improved cost efficiency, its world-class R&D engine, and
continued selective investment.
In September of 2014, Takeda announced a redesign of its global organizational structure to focus on and
leverage its growth drivers and to operate more efficiently and competitively as a global company. The
organization reflects the company mid- term growth drivers which are new global innovative products,
especially in the fields of Gastroenterology (GI) and Oncology, as well as Value Brands in Emerging Markets.
Under the new organizational structure, the R&D organization has been realigned into four Therapeutic Area
Units: Central Nervous System (CNS), Cardiovascular and Metabolic (CVM), Gastroenterology (GI), and
Oncology. Additionally, five regional commercial divisions have been newly established as Business Units:
Japan Pharma, the United States, Europe-Canada, Emerging Markets and Japan Consumer Healthcare, and two
global Specialty Business Units have been set up: Oncology and Vaccines.

Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (4502)
Consolidated Financial Statements for Fiscal 2014

Japan
Takeda will maintain its leading position in Japan by maximizing the sales of new and key products including
TAKECAB, launched in February 2015, ZAFATEK, approved in March 2015, AZILVA, and NESINA for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes. The growth of these new products will progressively offset the headwinds of price
pressure and increased generic penetration in Japan.
The United States
Takeda will actively invest in marketing in the U.S. in order to increase its market share through new products
including ENTYVIO, BRINTELLIX, and CONTRAVE.
Europe and Canada
While maintaining and expanding existing products, Takeda will strengthen its specialty care business by
focusing on new products including ENTYVIO, and ADCETRIS for the treatment of malignant lymphomas.
Emerging Markets
With its main focus on Russia, Brazil and China, Takeda's Emerging Market Business Unit will realize top-line
growth at circa +10% by maximizing sales of its existing portfolio of high-quality Value Brands, and by
continuing to successfully launch and penetrate the market with a diverse portfolio of new products including
Innovative Products and vaccines that meet the increasing needs of each market.

With the corporate philosophy of "Takeda-ism" (Integrity: Fairness, Honesty and Perseverance) developed over
its long history of more than 230 years at the core of its operations, Takeda strives to strengthen corporate
governance, further ensure compliance* with laws and regulations governing its operations and conducts
operations as a globally integrated company, according to the corporate mission to "strive towards better health
for people worldwide through leading innovation in medicine."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*With regards to the issues surrounding the CASE-J study of anti-hypertensive treatment BLOPRESS, Takeda has fully cooperated
with a third-party investigation. As a result of the investigation, it did not find any indications that Takeda was involved in “accessing
the research data,” “data falsification or fabrication,” nor had “direct involvement in the statistical analysis work.” However, it was
confirmed that there were multiple incidences of involvement and encouragement by Takeda employees in the investigator-led
clinical research study, raising suspicions about the fairness and independence of this study.
Based on the results of this investigation, Takeda has implemented internal disciplinary actions, and has strengthened its internal
review system for promotional materials by adding new members to review materials from both a legal and medical perspective.
Additionally, Takeda has strengthened its system for the screening and evaluation of donations. Takeda is implementing measures to
prevent recurrences of this kind of event in the future, including continuously ensuring transparency through clarifying the role of
each department and strengthening each department's checking systems, as well as thoroughly ensuring that Takeda employees are
completely uninvolved in investigator-led clinical research related to Takeda products.
The promotional activities by Takeda related to this case were deemed in violation of the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association's (JPMA's) "Prescription Drugs Promotion Code". As a consequence, Takeda received notice of sanctions imposed by the
JPMA that Takeda's activities as Vice President of the JPMA would be temporarily suspended.

(Management Indicators)
It is crucial to monitor the real performance of the business in order to enhance corporate value sustainably.
Takeda believes that “underlying growth”, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and exceptional items such
as product divestments, represents its real business performance. In accordance with this, Takeda regards
underlying revenue growth, underlying Core Earnings* growth, and Core EPS* (which measures real business
profitability) as important management indicators.
*Note: Core Earnings is calculated by excluding temporary items from operating profit such as impact from business
combination accounting, amortization of intangible assets, and impairment loss of intangible assets. Core EPS is
the per-share value of Core Net Profit, which is calculated by excluding items of the same nature as those excluded
from Core Earnings, and also the tax impact which applies to those items.

For the dividend policy, please refer to the “1. (3) Basic Policy for Profit Distribution and Dividends for Fiscal
2014 and 2015”.

4. Litigation and Other Legal Matters
(1) U.S. AWP litigation
In the U.S., civil lawsuits have been filed by patients, insurance companies and state governments against
numerous pharmaceutical companies, including major enterprises, over the sale of certain pharmaceutical
products. The complaints seek, among other things, damages resulting from price discrepancies between the
average wholesale price (AWP) as published and the actual selling prices. Thus, these types of lawsuits are
sometimes called “AWP litigation”. Actions are pending against TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc.* in three
state courts over lansoprazole (U.S. product name: Prevacid). In one case, the Company is also named as a
defendant.
Takeda is diligently defending itself in each of the remaining aforementioned lawsuits.
* TAP was merged into Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America, Inc. (hereinafter “TPNA”) in June 2008 and
TPNA changed its name to Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. (“TPUSA”) in January 2012. TAP marketed
Prevacid before its merger with TPNA.
(2) Product liability litigation regarding pioglitazone-containing products
The Company, Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. (“TPUSA”), and certain Company Affiliates located in the
U.S. have been named as defendants in lawsuits pending in U.S. federal and state courts in which plaintiffs
allege to have developed bladder cancer or other injuries as a result of taking products containing type 2
diabetes treatment pioglitazone (U.S. brand name: ACTOS) (hereafter, “ACTOS” is used to refer generally to
Takeda products containing pioglitazone). Eli Lilly & Co. (“Eli Lilly”) is a defendant in many of these lawsuits.
Also, proposed personal injury class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada, a claim seeking compensation
for bladder cancer has been filed in France, and a claim seeking compensation for bladder cancer has been filed
in Germany.
Of the nine lawsuits tried to-date in the U.S. or state courts, five cases have resulted in judgments in favor of
Takeda. Plaintiffs in those cases are challenging the judgments in post-trial motions or appeals.
In 2014, the first trial was conducted in the federal multi-district litigation (“MDL”)*, in the case of Terrence Allen,
et al. v. TPNA, et al. On April 7, 2014, the jury reached a verdict in favor of plaintiffs and awarded $1,475 thousand
in compensatory damages against Takeda defendants and Eli Lilly, allocating liability 75% to Takeda defendants
and 25% to Eli Lilly. The jury also assessed $6 billion in punitive damages against Takeda defendants and $3 billion
in punitive damages against Eli Lilly. In June, Takeda and Eli Lilly filed post-trial motions challenging the verdict.
In August, the court denied the post-trial motion for judgment in favor of Takeda and Eli Lilly and in September,
entered a judgment on the jury verdict mentioned above. The compensatory damages award was reduced from
$1,475 thousand to $1,270 thousand under New York law as the result of this judgment. On October 27, 2014, the
court ruled on the post-trial motion to reduce the punitive damage award, entering an amended judgment to reduce
the punitive damage award against Takeda defendants to $27.65 million and against Eli Lilly to $9.22 million.
Takeda and Eli Lilly appealed this judgment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
In October 2014, the jury in a state court located in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, found in favor of the
plaintiff and awarded $2,050 thousand in compensatory damages, and the trial court thereafter entered judgment on
this award. Takeda has appealed this judgment. In a separate trial in the same court in February 2015, the jury found
in favor of the plaintiff and awarded $2.318 million in compensatory damages and $1.334 million in punitive
damages. Takeda’s post-trial motions challenging the verdict are pending. In November 2014, the jury in a state
court located in Berkeley County, West Virginia found in favor of Takeda on plaintiffs’ claims that Takeda failed to
warn about the risks of bladder cancer or that ACTOS caused plaintiff’s bladder cancer. However, the jury found in

- 24 -

Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (4502)
Consolidated Financial Statements for Fiscal 2014

favor of plaintiffs on their claim for spoliation of evidence and awarded $155 thousand in compensatory damages.
The trial court thereafter entered judgment on this award. Takeda has appealed this judgment.
In April of 2015, the Company and TPUSA reached agreement that is expected to resolve the vast majority of
ACTOS product liability lawsuits pending against Takeda in the U.S., and this agreement was announced on April
29 (U.S. time April 28). The settlement would cover all bladder cancer claims pending in any U.S. court as of the
date of settlement, and claimants with unfiled claims represented by counsel as of the date of settlement and within
three days thereafter are also eligible to participate. The settlement will become effective if 95% of current litigants
and claimants opt in, and once that threshold is achieved, Takeda agrees to pay $2.37 billion into a settlement fund.
That figure will rise to $2.4 billion if 97% or more of the current litigants and claimants opt to participate in the
settlement. Under the settlement, current litigants and claimants who meet prescribed criteria would receive payouts
from the fund. In light of the settlement, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals entered an order dismissing the appeal in
the Allen case without prejudice to reinstate the appeal within 180 days.
Takeda believes that the claims made in this litigation are without merit, and does not admit liability. Takeda
believes that the company acted responsibly with regard to ACTOS. Takeda will continue to vigorously defend
through all available legal means any cases that continue or are newly filed after the settlement.
Upon reaching agreement towards settlement, Takeda booked a $2.7 billion (324.1 billion yen) provision in the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 to cover the settlement, costs associated with defending the remaining cases and
for other related litigation.
Takeda stands behind the substantial data that confirm a positive benefit/risk profile for ACTOS, which includes
more than 14 years of clinical and patient experience with the product. Takeda’s decision to settle does not change
the company’s continued commitment to ACTOS. ACTOS has been approved for use in 95 countries, including the
U.S., Japan, several in Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada and Russia, and continues to be available as a treatment
option in the U.S. and other countries.
* An MDL consolidates similar cases filed in federal courts under one federal jurisdiction primarily for pre-trial
and discovery purposes.

(3) Patent infringement litigation and administrative litigation regarding colchicine product
On September 30, 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted approval to Hikma
Pharmaceuticals PLC (“Hikma”) for colchicine capsules, to be marketed under the name Mitigare. In response
Takeda filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Hikma and Hikma subsidiaries in the District Court for the
District of Delaware asserting that their colchicine product infringes several Takeda patents applicable to
Colcrys, the first single-ingredient oral colchicine product approved by the FDA. Takeda also filed a request for
a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and a preliminary injunction prohibiting the launch of Mitigare. On
October 9, the court granted a TRO pending its decision on Takeda’s motion for a preliminary injunction. On
November 4, the court denied Takeda’s motion for a preliminary injunction. The court further ruled, however,
that the TRO would remain in place, provided Takeda filed an immediate, expedited appeal. In response,
Takeda filed a notice of appeal in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. On January 9, 2015, the Federal Circuit
Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of the preliminary injunction, allowing Hikma to launch its
product. Takeda intends to proceed with its patent infringement claims against Hikma in the trial court, where
Takeda will seek a permanent injunction and damages, including lost profits caused by the launch of Hikma’s
product.
- 25 -

Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (4502)
Consolidated Financial Statements for Fiscal 2014

In parallel, shortly after filing the patent infringement lawsuit in October 2014, Takeda filed a lawsuit against
the FDA in the District Court for the District of Columbia seeking an order rescinding or staying approval of
Mitigare. The lawsuit claims that the FDA violated the Administrative Procedure Act in approving Hikma's
Mitigare. On January 9, 2015, the court denied Takeda’s claims. Takeda has appealed the court’s ruling.

5. Basic Approach to the Selection of Accounting Standards
Takeda has been applying International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) from the fiscal year ending March
31, 2014 (fiscal year 2013) for the aim to such as improve comparison of financial information with
pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. and Europe, increase financing options, and allow Takeda to unify
accounting procedures across the group.

cash provided by (used in) operating activities" in the fiscal 2013, to represent the actual realities of the
cash flows management more appropriately, the Company changed the classification of "Interest
received" and "Dividends received" to "Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities" and the
classification of " Interest paid" to "Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities" effective from

(Note 1) Restructuring expenses are from reorganization, such as the consolidation of a number of sites and
functions (including the potential merger or liquidation of subsidiaries) and the reduction of the
workforce to build an efficient operating model. The major item in these expenses was the early
retirement payments for the workforce.

associated with court cases against plaintiffs who do not participate in the settlement, and for other
related expenses. Takeda also recognized the insurance receivable of ¥50.0 billion which is anticipated
to be covered by product liability insurance. In total, the net amount was booked as other operating
expense.

million yen, respectively. Those are all related to the transactions with financial institutions and are
not recognized as financial liabilities in the consolidated financial position because the possibility of
loss from guarantees is remote.

(Notes to Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity)
1. Put Options Granted to Non-controlling Interests
The put options granted to non-controlling interests by an overseas subsidiary are measured at present
value and recognized as financial liability, and the same amount is deducted from capital surplus. As of
March 31, 2015, the balance has become zero due to the exercise of all put options.

structure to focus on sales to outside customers and discontinued to represent the revenue classification, i.e.
"Sales to outside customers" and "Intersegment sales and transfers." As a result, only "Revenue" which
means "Sales to outside customers" is shown in the table. For fair comparison over the same period last year,
the amounts reported in the same period of last year were modified according to the new classification.
