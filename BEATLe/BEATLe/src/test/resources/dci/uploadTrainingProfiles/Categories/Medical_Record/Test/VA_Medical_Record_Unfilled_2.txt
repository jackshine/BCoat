NOTE: Under HIPAA guidelines you can be charged a reasonable fee for copying records. You may also be
charged for postage if you ask that records be mailed to you. HIPAA allows 30 days for a provider to respond
to your request for records, with one 30-day extension for good reason. Your specific state laws may include
a lower fee for copies of records or a shorter time for the provider to respond to your request.
