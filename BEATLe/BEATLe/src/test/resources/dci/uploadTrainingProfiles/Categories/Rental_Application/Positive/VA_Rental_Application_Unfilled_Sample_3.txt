________ TERMS AND CONDITIONS: The undersigned hereby makes application for use of Edgewood
facilities and certifies that the information in the application is correct. The undersigned agrees to exercise the utmost
care in the use of the facilities and the surrounding property, and to hold the City, its officers, employees and agents,
harmless from all damages, liabilities, injuries or losses to persons or property resulting from use of the facilities. The
Applicant agrees to adhere to all rules and regulations on this form and in rental guidelines.
________ FEES: Fees are set forth in the City’s fee schedule. Refer to current fee schedule for fees. The same fees
apply to profit and non-profit agencies/organizations with the following exceptions:
 Agencies/organizations with a direct benefit to the City (such as East Pierce Fire and Rescue, Fife & Puyallup
school districts, Mt. View-Edgewood Water Company, Edgewood Friends of the Parks) are exempt from all
fees.
 Written appeals regarding fees/rates for non-profit agencies/organizations will be reviewed by the City
Manager. Appeal decisions are made at the City Manager’s discretion on an individual basis, per appeal.
________ RESERVATIONS: In order to reserve the facility, at least ½ of the rental fee is required at the time the
application is submitted and the facility is booked. The date is not reserved until at least ½ of the rental fee has been
received by the City. The remainder of the rental fee PLUS the deposit are due at least 30 calendar days prior to the
event date. If the City does not receive a cancellation notice at least 5 business days prior to the date reserved,
½ the rental fee will be forfeited.
A new application must be submitted and approved every year for reoccurring annual events.
Applicant must provide adequate chaperons for any function that is attended by any person under the age of 18 years.
________ ACCESS: One security access card will be issued to the applicant, which will allow entry into the

building, tracking the user and times used. This access card can be deposited in the outdoor drop box after
clean up has been completed or returned to City Hall on the next regular business day after the event. The
Applicant is responsible for the use and return of the access card. If the access card is not returned, the cost
for replacement will be deducted from the deposit amount.
________ KITCHEN USE: The kitchen in the Civic Center Community Room, which includes a range,
refrigerator/freezer and dishwasher, is available for your use. The City does not provide cookware, dishes or utensils.
________ DEPOSIT: A City staff member will perform a walkthrough with the Applicant prior to the day of the

ensure that no damage has occurred beyond what may be noted on the initial walk through. Should there be any
findings, the Applicant will be notified promptly. The Applicant is responsible for cleaning. The premises must be
left in the same or better condition as the time at which the rental period began. All cleaning must be done
immediately after the event. Cleaning includes, but is not limited to, removal of all trash, decorations, food or other
material brought into the facilities; returning any furniture, tables, trash receptacles, or other items belonging to the
City to its original position; washing any counters, sinks, chairs, tables that were used if necessary; vacuuming
carpets, cleaning kitchen, cleaning patio, sweeping floors, etc. The dumpster is available onsite in the north parking
lot. If you have filled a trash can, take the full bag(s) to the dumpster and replace the plastic trash can bag(s), which

In the event that City property has been damaged or additional cleaning is required, the Applicant will accept the
City’s estimate of the amount incurred. The cost of any cleaning or repairs deemed necessary will be charged to the
Organization’s/Applicant’s deposit. Should the cost of cleaning or repairs exceed the amount of the deposit, the
Applicant will receive an invoice for said charges, which will be due within 15 days of the date of the invoice.
