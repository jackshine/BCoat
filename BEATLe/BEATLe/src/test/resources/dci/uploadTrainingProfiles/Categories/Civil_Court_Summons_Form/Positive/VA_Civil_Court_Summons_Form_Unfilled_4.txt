CIVIL COURT OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK
In-Person (Pro Se) Clerk
INSTRUCTIONS FOR PLAINTIFFS SUING IN PERSON

A.

SERVICE

1. You may NOT serve the summons yourself.
2. Anyone over the age of 18 years, and NOT A PARTY to the action may serve the
summons.
3. If you wish, you may employ the services of a Process Server or Sheriff’s Office. See
the yellow pages of the phone book to locate a process server and the blue pages for the sheriff.
4. A COPY of the summons may be served on the defendant personally or by substituted
or conspicuous service.
a. Personal delivery: A copy of the summons and complaint may be served by giving
it to the defendant in his/her hand.
b. Substituted delivery: A copy of summons and complaint may be left with a person
of ‘suitable age and discretion’ other than the defendant at the defendant’s residence
or place of business.
c. Conspicuous Place delivery: If no one can be found to receive the summons and
complaint by personal or substituted delivery after a diligent effort to serve the papers
(at least three attempts), the summons and complaint may be served by conspicuous
place delivery. This is also known as “nail and mail.” This delivery requires that a
copy of the summons and complaint be affixed to the door of the actual residence or
place of business of the defendant, normally with adhesive tape.
MAILING: If you do b or c above, a copy of the summons and complaint must be
mailed to the defendant in an envelope marked “Personal and Confidential” within 20
days of the affixing or the substitution. The envelope may not indicate that it is from
an attorney or that it concerns an action against the defendant.
5. The summons must be served within 120 days from the day of issuance of the index
number.
6. If the defendant is a corporation, the COPY of the summons must be served on an
officer, managing or general agent or the ‘cashier’ of that corporation. The person making the
service shall find out the name of the person served and the office s/he holds in the corporation.
7. Service on the defendant may be made on any day EXCEPT on SUNDAY.
B.

AFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE

1. After the COPY of the summons has been served, the person who served it shall fill
out the Affidavit of Service. The Affidavit of Service shall include a description of the color of
skin, hair color, approximate age, approximate weight and height, and other identifying features
of the person served.
2. After the Affidavit of Service has been filled out the server shall sign it before a
Notary Public and have it notarized.

3. The original summons, with the Affidavit of Service filled out, signed and notarized,
must be returned to the Clerk’s Office in the county where the action was brought.
4. The defendant normally has twenty (20) days, exclusive of the day s/he is served, to
appear in court and file an answer. However, if the summons is served outside the City of New
York, or by other than in-hand delivery, the defendant has thirty (30) days to answer from the
filing of the proof of service. Since the defendant’s time to answer does not run until the
Affidavit of Service is filed with the court, you should file it as soon as possible.
C.

SCHEDULING DATE OF INQUEST, TRIAL OR ARBITRATION

1. If the defendant answers, the court will mail you a date for appearance. If you do not
receive a court date within three weeks of the expiration of the defendant’s time to answer, you
can come to court and request an Inquest. This is a hearing before a Judge, in the absence of the
defendant. Alternatively, you may visit the Civil Court’s website and file a Request for Inquest
on-line at: nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/civil/inquests_nonatty.shtml.
2. IN NEW YORK COUNTY:
a. If any cause of action is over $10,000, when the defendant answers the Clerk will
set a date for Trial. Both sides will be notified by mail as to the date, time and place of the Trial.
b. If no cause of action is over $10,000, when the defendant answers the Clerk will set
a date for a pre-arbitration conference. Both sides will be notified by mail as to the scheduled
date, time and place.
(1) On the scheduled date bring any documents that you have but you need not
bring your witness(es) since this will only be a conference to determine the
possibility of a settlement or the necessity for a trial.
(2) Actions which cannot be settled or otherwise disposed of will next be
assigned to Arbitration. Both sides will be notified by mail as to the scheduled
date, time and place of the Arbitration hearing.
3. IN ALL OTHER COUNTIES:
When the defendant answers the Clerk will set a date for Trial. Both sides will be
notified by mail as to the date, time and place of the Trial.
D.

INQUEST, TRIAL OR ARBITRATION

1. On the day you come to Court for Trial, Inquest or Arbitration, be sure to bring with
you any witnesses and all papers and other evidence you wish to present to the judge in order to
prove your case.
2. Proof of services or repairs for $2,000 or less may be made by an itemized bill
containing a Certified Statement, from an authorized employee of the firm used, stating that the
amounts charged are the usual and customary charges therefore; that it has been paid; and that no
part of the payment received will be refunded.
“A Certified Statement” is a statement which has been sworn to before a Notary Public
or Commissioner of Deeds as a true statement.
3. A copy of the itemized bill which has been Certified, and notice that the plaintiff
intends to place it into evidence at the hearing, must be served on the defendant at least 10 days
before the hearing. This may be done by mail.

E.

AFTER TRIAL, INQUEST, ARBITRATION

1. If there is a decision in your favor after Trial, after Inquest, or after Arbitration, see the
Judgment Clerk in this office for entry of a judgment in your behalf. Allow 10 days for
processing of papers prior to requesting judgment.
2. After Arbitration, if either party is dissatisfied, s/he may request a TRIAL DE NOVO
within (30) days from the date the decision was filed. Such demand must be accompanied by
payment of the Arbitrator’s fees. Indigent litigants may qualify for a Poor Persons Order.
F.

COSTS

1. The prevailing party is eligible to receive costs.
2. Costs are to be based on the stage at which the action ends and the amount awarded to
the prevailing party. If the award is $6,000. or under, the costs may be up to $115. If the award
is over $6.000, the costs may be up to $300.
If you have any further questions about costs, please see the clerk.
3. Due to the nature of the proof provided in pro se cases, a pro se plaintiff may have to
appear in front of a judge for an assessment of damages when a defendant fails to answer. This
situation will be treated by the Court as a default at Stage 1, and costs will be awarded following
CCA § 1901 (a)1 or (b)1.
G.

GENERAL

1. You are responsible for maintaining and tracking your case. Make copies of all
documents for your records.
2. Always bring your records with you when you come to Court.
