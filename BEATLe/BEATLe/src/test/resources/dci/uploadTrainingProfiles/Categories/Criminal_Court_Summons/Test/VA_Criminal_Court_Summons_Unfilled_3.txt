NOTICE: Family Court Act §154(c) provides that petitions brought pursuant to Articles 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 of the
Family Court Act, in which an order of protection is sought or in which a violation of an order of protection is
alleged, may be served outside the State of New York upon a Respondent who is not a resident or domiciliary of
the State of New York. If no other grounds for obtaining personal jurisdiction over the Respondent exist aside
from the application of this provision, the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the Respondent is limited to the
issue of the request for, or alleged violation of, the order of protection. Where the Respondent has been served
with this summons and petition and does not appear, the Family Court may proceed to a hearing with respect to
issuance or enforcement of the order of protection.
