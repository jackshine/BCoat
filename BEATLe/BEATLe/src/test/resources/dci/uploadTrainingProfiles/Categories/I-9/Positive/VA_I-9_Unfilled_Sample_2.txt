Form I-9 CNMI, Employment
Eligibility Verification

Department of Homeland Security
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services

Instructions

Read all instructions carefully before completing this form.
Anti-Discrimination Notice. It is illegal to discriminate against
any individual (other than an alien not authorized to work in the
United States) in hiring, discharging, or recruiting or referring for a
fee because of that individual's national origin or citizenship status.
It is illegal to discriminate against work-authorized individuals.
Employers CANNOT specify which document(s) they will accept
from an employee. The refusal to hire an individual because the
documents presented have a future expiration date may also
constitute illegal discrimination. For more information, call the
Office of Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair
Employment Practices at 1-800-255-8155.

What Is the Purpose of This Form?
The purpose of this form is to verify the identity and
employment authorization of each new employee (both citizen
and noncitizen) hired in the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands (CNMI) after November 27, 2009.

When Should Form I-9 CNMI Be Used?
All employees (citizens and noncitizens) hired in the CNMI
after November 27, 2009, and working in the CNMI must
complete Form I-9 CNMI. The Form I-9 CNMI is only for use
in the CNMI.

Filling Out Form I-9 CNMI
Section 1, Employee
This part of the form must be completed no later than the time
of hire, which is the actual beginning of employment.
Providing the Social Security Number is voluntary, except for
employees hired by employers participating in the USCIS
Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program (EVerify). The employer is responsible for ensuring that
Section 1 is timely and properly completed.
From November 28, 2009, through November 27, 2011, a
CNMI employee with a valid foreign passport and unexpired
work authorization document granted under CNMI law should
check "alien authorized to work" in Section 1 and enter the 6digit Legal Immigration Information Database System
(LIIDS) number in the space provided.
Noncitizen nationals of the United States are persons born in
American Samoa, certain former citizens of the former Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands, and certain children of
noncitizen nationals born abroad.

Employers should note the work authorization expiration
date (if any) shown in Section 1. For employees who indicate
an employment authorization expiration date in Section 1,
employers are required to reverify employment authorization
for employment on or before the date shown. Note that some
employees may leave the expiration date blank if they are
aliens whose work authorization does not expire (e.g., asylees,
refugees, certain citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia
or the Republic of the Marshall Islands). For such employees,
reverification does not apply unless they choose to present in
Section 2 evidence of employment authorization that contains
an expiration date (e.g., Employment Authorization Document
(Form I-766)).
Preparer/Translator Certification
The Preparer/Translator Certification must be completed if
Section 1 is prepared by a person other than the employee. A
preparer/translator may be used only when the employee is
unable to complete Section 1 on his or her own. However, the
employee must still sign Section 1 personally.
Section 2, Employer
For the purpose of completing this form, the term "employer"
means all employers including those recruiters and referrers
for a fee who are agricultural associations, agricultural
employers, or farm labor contractors. Employers must
complete Section 2 by examining evidence of identity and
employment authorization within three business days of the
date employment begins. However, if an employer hires an
individual for less than three business days, Section 2 must be
completed at the time employment begins. Employers cannot
specify which document(s) listed on the last page of Form I-9
CNMI employees present to establish identity and
employment authorization. Employees may present any List A
document OR a combination of a List B and a List C
document.
If an employee is unable to present a required document (or
documents), the employee must present an acceptable receipt
in lieu of a document listed on the last two pages of this form.
Receipts showing that a person has applied for an initial grant
of employment authorization, or for renewal of employment
authorization, are not acceptable. Employees must present
receipts within three business days of the date employment
begins and must present valid replacement documents within
90 days or other specified time.

Form I-9 CNMI (Rev. 06/27/10)Y

Employers must record in Section 2:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Document title;
Issuing authority;
Document number;
Expiration date, if any; and
The date employment begins.

Employers must sign and date the certification in Section 2.
Employees must present original documents. Employers may,
but are not required to, photocopy the document(s) presented.
If photocopies are made, they must be made for all new hires.
Photocopies may only be used for the verification process and
must be retained with Form I-9 CNMI. Employers are still
responsible for completing and retaining Form I-9 CNMI.
For more detailed information, you may refer to the
USCIS Handbook for Employers (Form M-274). You may
obtain the handbook using the contact information found
under the header "USCIS Forms and Information."
Section 3, Updating and Reverification
Employers must complete Section 3 when updating and/or
reverifying Form I-9 CNMI. Employers must reverify
employment authorization of their employees on or before the
work authorization expiration date recorded in Section 1 (if
any). Employers CANNOT specify which document(s) they
will accept from an employee.
A. If an employee's name has changed at the time this form
is being updated/reverified, complete Block A.
B. If an employee is rehired within three years of the date
this form was originally completed and the employee is
still authorized to be employed on the same basis as
previously indicated on this form (updating), complete
Block B and the signature block.
C. If an employee is rehired within three years of the date
this form was originally completed and the employee's
work authorization has expired or if a current
employee's work authorization is about to expire
(reverification), complete Block B; and:
1. Examine any document that reflects the employee
is authorized to work in the United States (see List
A or C);
2. Record the document title, document number, and
expiration date (if any) in Block C; and
3. Complete the signature block.
Note that for reverification purposes, employers have the
option of completing a new Form I-9 CNMI instead of
completing Section 3.

U.S. Immigration Law and the CNMI
U.S. immigration law will extend to the CNMI on November
28, 2009, as a result of Title VII of the Consolidated Natural
Resources Act of 2008 (CNRA). Like all other U.S.
employers, CNMI employers will be required to verify the
identity and employment authorization of all individuals they
hire for employment, regardless of citizenship, to ensure that
they have valid documentation that authorizes them to work.
After November 27, 2009, CNMI employers may hire or
continue to employ aliens whose employment authorization
was granted under CNMI law before November 28, 2009,
within certain limitations. The CNRA allows alien workers
lawfully present in the CNMI on November 28, 2009, and
authorized to be employed in the CNMI to be considered
authorized to work in the CNMI until their employment
authorization expires under CNMI law or until November 27,
2011, whichever is shorter. Certain documents issued by the
CNMI to aliens with unrestricted work authorization in the
CNMI or aliens granted permanent resident status under
CNMI law and issued Permanent Resident Cards by the CNMI
between April 1, 1977 and April 23, 1981, are designated as
List A documents. These documents are found on the last page
of the Form I-9 CNMI.

What Is the Filing Fee?
There is no associated filing fee for completing Form I-9
CNMI. This form is not filed with USCIS or any government
agency. Form I-9 CNMI must be retained by the employer and
made available for inspection by U.S. Government officials as
specified in the Privacy Act Notice below.
