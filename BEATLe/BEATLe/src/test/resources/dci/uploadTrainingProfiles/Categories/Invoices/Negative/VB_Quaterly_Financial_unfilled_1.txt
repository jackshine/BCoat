1. Financial Results and Financial Position
(1) Financial Results
1) Summary of financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 (hereinafter “the fiscal year under
review”), the Japanese economy showed a gradual recovery due to such factors as
improved corporate performance—especially among exporters—and renewed capital
investment, against a backdrop of monetary easing measures and the government’s
economic policy. Meanwhile, however, the global economy remained uncertain:
although the U.S. continued its gradual recovery, and the European economy also
showed signs that it has at last bottomed out, concerns about the slowdown of the
Chinese and other emerging economies intensified.
According to 2013 Advertising Expenditures in Japan, an estimate for advertising
expenditures in Japan for the 2013 calendar year compiled by Dentsu Inc.
(hereinafter “Dentsu” or the “Company”), advertising expenditures totaled 5,976.2
billion yen, an increase of 1.4% compared with the 2012 calendar year, and marking
the second consecutive year of growth. Growth in the second half of the year under
review was strong, due to the effect of continuous economic recovery fueled by the
economic policies dubbed “Abenomics” and the appearance of rush demand ahead of
the consumption-tax hike from April 1, 2014. Additionally, data compiled by the
Dentsu Group’s (hereinafter the “Group”) Carat, in March 2014 for the 2013 calendar
year shows that the growth rate of worldwide advertising expenditures increased
3.3% compared with the 2012 calendar year. By region, the growth rate was 9.9%
compared with the 2012 calendar year in Latin America; 5.0% in Asia Pacific; 4.8%
in Central and Eastern Europe; and 3.5% in North America, but declined by 1.7% in
Western Europe.
In March 2013, the Group acquired major U.K. media and digital communications
agency Aegis Group plc (hereinafter “Aegis”). This acquisition marked a new first
step by the Group toward becoming a truly global player. Post-acquisition integration
is proceeding smoothly, and has led to winning several new accounts. In Japan, the
Group was committed to providing integrated solutions, including the use of Big Data,
to meet rising client demand. Initiatives such as these combined with the rush
demand ahead of the consumption-tax hike enabled the Group to surpass its initial
performance forecast for the fiscal year under review. In particular, the Company’s
non-consolidated ordinary income and net income were its highest ever.

7/46

As a result, for the fiscal year under review, the Group posted consolidated billings
(net sales) of 2,309,359 million yen, an increase of 19.0% compared with the
previous fiscal year; gross profit of 594,072 million yen, an increase of 71.7%;
operating income before amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets of
114,186 million yen, an increase of 81.7%; operating income of 71,490 million yen,
an increase of 22.3%; ordinary income of 82,538 million yen, an increase of 39.8%;
and net income of 38,800 million yen, an increase of 6.8%.
The operating income before amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets
comprises the Company’s operating income figure to which has been added 27,029
million yen as amortization of goodwill incurred through acquisitions (including the
acquisition of Aegis) and 15,666 million yen as amortization of other intangible
assets.
Following the acquisition of Aegis, the consolidated business performance of Dentsu
Aegis Network Ltd. (trade name changed from Aegis Group plc effective March 26,
2013, hereinafter “DAN”) is reflected in the consolidated statements of income from
the first quarter of the fiscal year under review.
The Group has formulated a new medium-term management plan, “Dentsu 2017 and
Beyond,” which began in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. Below are the
numerical targets of the Group’s new medium-term management plan in the fiscal
year 2017, and the progress toward achieving them.
- Gross profit organic growth rate CAGR: Target: 3-5%
Actual results in the fiscal year under review: 7.7%
- Ratio of gross profit generated from operating markets outside of Japan: Target:
55% or higher
Actual results in the fiscal year under review: 48%
- Ratio of gross profit generated from the digital sector: Target: 35% or higher
Actual results in the fiscal year under review: 28%
- Operating margin before amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets*:
Target: 20% or higher
Actual results in the fiscal year under review: 19.2%
* Operating margin before amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets =
Operating income before amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets ÷
gross profit

2) Outlook for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015
Data compiled by Carat in March 2014 for the 2014 calendar year forecasts that the
growth rate of worldwide advertising expenditures will increase 4.8% compared with
the 2013 calendar year. By region, Carat forecasts growth of 12.8% compared with
the 2013 calendar year in Latin America; 5.6% in Asia Pacific; 5.0% in Central and
12/46

Eastern Europe; 4.3% in North America; and 1.8% in Western Europe.
Against this backdrop, for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015, on a consolidated
basis, Dentsu forecasts billings (net sales) of 2,371.2 billion yen, an increase of 2.7%
year on year; gross profit of 623.0 billion yen, an increase of 4.9%; operating
income before amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets of 115.5 billion
yen, an increase of 1.2%; operating income of 72.5 billion yen, an increase of 1.4%;
ordinary income of 77.9 billion yen, a decrease of 5.6%; and net income of 31.1
billion yen, a decrease of 19.8%. Calculations were made using the average
exchange rate during the January–December 2013 period. The exchange rate was

Going forward, Dentsu is considering the voluntary adoption of IFRS for the fiscal
year ending March 31, 2015 in order to increase comparability in international capital
markets.

13/46

(2) Financial Position
As of March 31, 2014, total assets increased by 432,750 million yen from the end of the
previous fiscal year due to the increase in notes and accounts receivable—trade. In
contrast, total liabilities increased by 132,892 million yen due to the increase in notes
and accounts payable—trade and long-term loans payable. Total net assets increased by
299,858 million yen primarily due to the increase in foreign currency translation
adjustment and the posting of net income.
Cash flow status for the fiscal year under review
As of March 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents (hereinafter “cash”) amounted to
227,128 million yen from the 207,578 million yen posted at the end of the previous fiscal
year. As net cash provided by operating activities and financing activities exceeded net
cash used in investing activities, cash at the end of the fiscal year under review
increased by 19,549 million yen from the end of the previous fiscal year.
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to 97,540 million yen compared with
83,295 million yen in the previous fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities
increased by 14,244 million yen from the previous fiscal year primarily due to the

amortization, and amortization of goodwill.

Net cash used in investing activities amounted to 318,087 million yen (51,236 million
yen used in the previous fiscal year). Net cash used in investing activities increased by

2. Management Policy
(1) Basic Management Policies
The global economy is made up of various regions with distinct characteristics that
influence each other while undergoing constant changes. Regions include the United
States which continues to enjoy stable growth; Asia and emerging economies where
growth continues to be relatively high; and Japan and Europe which are maturing
economies of significant scale. With the acquisition of Aegis completed in March 2013,
the Group has transformed into a truly global network, and the execution of strategies
adapted to the business climate in each part of the world is of crucial importance.
Additionally, in a society where marketing convergence is progressing, innovation in
the digital sector is expected to become an even more significant factor in the success
of our clients’ businesses.
In this business climate, the Group aims to become the agency network that continues
to contribute on a global basis to the business success of its clients, and furthermore,
to maximize their corporate value, in ways that surpass the boundaries of the
advertising business to date.
In line with this basic policy, the Group has drawn up its new medium-term
management plan, “Dentsu 2017 and Beyond,” which started from FY2013.
(2) Targeted Management Indicators
The new medium-term management plan includes the following numerical targets for
the fiscal year 2017.
- Gross profit organic growth rate CAGR: 3–5%
- Ratio of gross profit generated from operating markets outside of Japan: 55% or
higher
- Ratio of gross profit generated from digital sector: 35% or higher
- Operating margin before amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets: 20%
or higher

16/46

(3) Tasks to Be Addressed by the Group and Its Management Strategy
The Group has formulated the following strategies to achieve these numerical targets.
1) To establish a comprehensive global network that supports clients’
businesses around the globe
The Group will use the client base built up by the Company and Aegis as a stepping
stone to roll out the Group’s strengths in the digital sector and sports-content
business on a global scale, while at the same time expanding its competitive global
network worldwide through mergers and acquisitions.
Looking at the major regions, in the North American market which is maintaining
stable growth, the Group will strengthen its partnerships with existing networks that
have high growth potential, and create an improved, broader service lineup in order
to capture new global clients and to increase billings. Furthermore, in the fastgrowing emerging economies, the Group will lay the foundation for providing topclass solutions in each market through mergers, acquisitions, and aggressive
investment in the Group’s business. In the Japanese and Western European markets,
where the Group already has a solid business base, the Group will pursue the
benefits of scale and aim to create and offer new value going beyond the framework
of conventional advertising business.
2) To reinforce competitive strengths in the digital space that plays a
central role in all client solutions
The progress of marketing convergence is transforming clients’ business processes,
and digital solutions have become a key factor in business growth. Taking these
factors into consideration, the Group will provide cutting-edge solutions that more
directly support the success of its clients’ businesses. At the same time, the Group
will make investments as necessary, share knowledge within the Group, and
integrate its R&D capabilities.
3) To make further innovations in the area of business process management
so as to enhance profitability
The Group is pursuing sustainable growth by carrying out aggressive investments
and business expansion worldwide. To this end, a revenue base that generates a
stable cash flow is required, and the Group will remain tireless in its commitment to
improving the profitability of its core business. In order to restructure its value chain
17/46

to maximize profits, the Group will work to control costs on a global basis, and
inventory capabilities of the Group’s companies including the Company in each area
of service to implement necessary reorganization. The Group will also review its
asset holdings from the viewpoint of profitability to increase asset efficiency.
4) To reinforce the business platform in Japan, the Group’s largest
operating market
Although the acquisition of Aegis has given the Group a truly global network, the
Group’s solid business base in Japan remains its greatest strength. The Group will
achieve sustainable growth in this market by making even more effort to increase its
competitiveness and profitability.
Furthermore, Japan is the region where the Company has the most resources for
supporting every facet of its clients’ businesses, and has the strongest relations with
its clients. The Company is therefore committed to becoming the Group’s role model
for building a business for the next generation by expanding its service domain in
Japan.
5) CSR initiatives
In line with its global expansion, in April 2013 the Group formulated an updated
Dentsu Group Code of Conduct, stating the Group’s core principles for CSR. The Code
of Conduct adopts as its framework ISO 26000, an international standard for
corporate social responsibility. Under this framework, the Group uses the following
seven core themes to guide its CSR efforts: Corporate governance; Respect for
human rights; Ensuring a safe and civilized working environment; Environmental
protection; Fair business practices; Addressing consumer issues; and Contributing to
the community.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, the Group carried out continued support for
recovery following the Great East Japan Earthquake through its cooperation with the
Tohoku Rokkonsai (Six Souls Festival) and participation in the Michinoku Recovery
Project Partners consortium. In the field of human rights, the Group is committed to
raising awareness of human rights that is essential to communication, the core of its
business, through initiatives that include continuing to run a Human Rights Slogans
program. In the environmental field as well, where the Company received the EcoFirst Company certification in 2008, the Group engages in various environmental
activities aimed at achieving a sustainable society. Furthermore, in the business field,
the Group strives to resolve the issues faced by Japan through measures such as
18/46

FOOD ACTION NIPPON, an ongoing campaign aimed at boosting Japan’s food selfsufficiency rate.
Going forward, by further deepening its collaboration with DAN, which carries out
diverse CSR activities worldwide including the “30 Days of Green” environmental
campaign, the Group will continue its commitment to CSR efforts both in Japan and
overseas with the aim of contributing to resolve social issues as a leading global
group in communication services. For more information about Dentsu’s CSR activities,
see the Dentsu CSR Report (http://www.dentsu.com/csr/pdf/CSR_Report2013.pdf).

(Changes in Accounting Policies)
From the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, the Company applied the
“Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan
(ASBJ) Statement No. 26, May 17, 2012, and hereinafter the “Accounting Standard”)
and the “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Guidance
No. 25, May 17, 2012, and hereinafter the “Guidance”), except for the provisions
prescribed in Paragraph 35 of the Accounting Standard and Paragraph 67 of the
Guidance. The Company changed the accounting method to record the amount
calculated by deducting plan assets from retirement benefit obligations as a net
defined benefit liability (or as a net defined benefit asset if plan assets exceed
retirement benefit obligations), and unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and
unrecognized prior service cost were recorded as net defined benefit liability.
As for the application of the Accounting Standard, etc., in accordance with the
transitional treatment stipulated in Paragraph 37 of the Accounting Standard, the
amount of financial impact caused by this change was added to or deducted from
remeasurements of defined benefit plans in accumulated other comprehensive
income at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014.
As a result, a net defined benefit asset of 5,841 million yen and a net defined benefit
liability of 56,301 million yen were recorded at the end of the fiscal year ended March
31, 2014. Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased by 8,277 million yen.
Net assets per share decreased by 28.71 yen.

(Notes) 1. Other than above, Dentsu amortized 2,284 million yen in goodwill and posted the charge as
an extraordinary loss under the provision of Paragraph 32 of the “Practical Guidelines on
Accounting Standards for Capital Consolidation Procedures in Preparing Consolidated Financial
Statements” (Accounting Practice Committee Report No. 7, January 12, 2011). The
amortization of the goodwill resulted in a decrease in the Advertising segment.
2. Of the balance at the end of the period for the Advertising segment, 519,076 million yen
relating to the acquisition of the shares of Aegis Group plc is a provisional amount, as the
purchase price allocation has not been completed.

(Business Combination)
Business combination through share acquisition
1. Details and amounts of significant adjustments in initially-allocated purchase price
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, the purchase price allocation had not been
completed because the specification and mark-to-market valuation of identifiable
assets and liabilities of Dentsu Aegis Network Ltd. as of the date of the business
combination had not been finalized. Therefore, the Company followed a provisional
accounting procedure based on available and reasonable information, etc. at the time
of preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Adjustments in goodwill for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, as a result of a
review on the purchase price allocation are as follows:
