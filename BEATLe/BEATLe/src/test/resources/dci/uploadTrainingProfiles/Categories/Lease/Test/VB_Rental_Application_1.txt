FILL OUT COMPLETELY
ITIN = Individual Tax Identification Number
LINES 1 & 2:
If this is your parent’s or relative’s unit, indicate it as such.
LINE 3:
Students who lived on campus can use the Campus Housing Office as a financial reference to
show they paid rent on time previously and their College Housing/Residential-Life Office as a
reference to confirm responsible personal behavior. These are very important references
especially for the first-time renter. Fill this line out to provide landlords with information
necessary to check your references. Students also must submit a Reference Release available at
studenthousing.ucsc.edu for these two references and “How to Check a Rental Reference for a
UCSC Student” to give to the potential landlord.
LINE 4:
Print all names and ages of applicants for this unit. Each applicant fills out a separate application.
LINE 5:
List the type and the number of pets you own. If the pet is a dog or cat, provide a pet resume.
LINES 6 & 7:
Include your immediate supervisor’s name and direct phone number. If your supervisor is a
UCSC employee, give him or her a copy of your completed UCSC Reference Release Form so
they may provide a reference to the landlord for you.

Include the following if applicable, with Social Security # and account # blacked out:
∙ Most recent pay slip.
