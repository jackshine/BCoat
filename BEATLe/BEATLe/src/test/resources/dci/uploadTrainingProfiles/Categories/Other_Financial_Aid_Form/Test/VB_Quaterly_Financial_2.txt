TRANSLATION FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY

(Notes) 1. At the 54th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 25, 2014, the proposal of a “partial
amendments of the articles of incorporation” was approved. As a result, from the fiscal year ended December
31, 2014, the last day of the fiscal year changed from March 31 to December 31. Consolidated companies
whose fiscal year ended in March also changed to December. Accordingly, as the fiscal year ended December
31, 2014 was a transitional period, the consolidated fiscal year for consolidated companies whose fiscal year
ended in March was nine months from April 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, and for consolidated companies
whose fiscal year ends in December was twelve months from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014. As the
reporting of accounts for this fiscal year is an anomaly, the rates of change over the previous fiscal year are
omitted.
2. The Company carried out a stock split on October 1, 2014, at a ratio of three shares per one common share.
Accordingly, the net income per share and net income per share-diluted have been calculated presuming that
this stock split was carried out at the start of the previous consolidated fiscal year.

1. Overview of the overall earnings in the period under review
In light of the management environment surrounding the Company and its group companies during the fiscal
year under review, as for overseas operations, a stagnant macro economy in China and ASEAN countries
along with currency depreciation in emerging countries caused raw material prices to rise. However, despite
this and other factors, sales of personal care products continued to grow, backed by the implementation of
positive region-specific proposals.
Meanwhile in Japan, amid a moderate recovery in the economy despite signs of some lingering weakness,
sales remained steady as a result of the continuing introduction of high value-added products and actively
taking advantage of inbound demand from foreign tourists to Japan.
In this environment and under the banner “we constantly provide the world’s No.1 and unprecedented
products and services to everybody around the globe, and deliver comfort, impression and satisfaction,” the
Company and its group companies have been working to expand sales and income in order to achieve the Ninth
Medium-Term Management Plan for the three fiscal years from April 2014 to December 2016.

● Baby Care Products
Overseas, in China the Company has been strengthening its internet sales and promoting sales of products
imported from Japan, in addition to actively promoting and expanding the use of its stylish disposable diapers
and pants-type disposable diapers.
In Japan, the Company has continued to implement new proposals in the Moony series which fits comfortably
on the baby’s skin while preventing leakage, as well as actively taking advantage of demand from Japanese
consumers and inbound demand from foreign tourists to Japan. In addition, the Company endeavored to
expand its product line-up and strengthen relationships in the Mamy Poko series of highly absorbent diapers
featuring cute designs of Disney characters, and in sub-category products such as pants for children with
bed-wetting problems.
● Feminine Care Products
Overseas, in China the Company’s high-quality products featuring charming designs remain highly popular
with the younger generation there. In addition to this, the Company has been actively promoting sales in
emerging countries as well, and is endeavoring to expand its market share.
In Japan, the Company has been working at improving its products, such as the Sofy Hada Omoi series of
sanitary napkins that are gentle on sensitive skin during menses, and the popular Center-in series of sanitary
napkins in a stylish and compact pouch with a cute design. In this way, the Company has been offering new
value to meet the diversifying needs of women, and is working to revitalize the market.
● Health Care Products
In the continually growing domestic market for health care products and in line with the progression of Japan’s
aging society, the Company has been working to educate the public about products that enable elderly people
to continue with their lifestyle as before. In the Lifree incontinence care product line, the Company has
improved the absorbency of incontinence care products for men for the Lifree Slim Comfortable Pads for Men
series, which is designed to prevent urine leakage and stains on trousers. Along with the Charm Nap series, the
Company has continued its efforts to remove resistance to using these products by conveying that everyone
has light incontinence. In nursing care products, along with the Lifree series, the Company has also actively
promoted its products through TV commercials, on its website, during over-the-counter consultations at shops
and by creating shelf space at retailers based on daily activities. In this way, the Company has been leading in
the market for excretion care products.

● Clean and Fresh Products
In the domestic market for clean and fresh products, as living environments and lifestyles change, an
increasing numbers of customers want to clean their homes easily and within a limited time. The Company has
been working to expand sales and revitalize the market with a box-type wet tissue in the Silicot Wet Tissues
series that enables users to clean quickly with just one hand, as well as improving the Wave Handy Wiper
series of convenient wipes for cleaning the entire house by strengthening the ability of the replacement sheets
to pick up dirt and grime. In these ways, the Company has endeavored to revitalize the market by proposing
new ways for cleaning homes.

due to changes in the accounting period. As a result, the amounts and rates of change are omitted.
The Company has been working on introducing products focused on realizing a society where humans and
pets can coexist comfortably and in good health at all times, amid the shift to dogs and cats living inside
homes rather than outside, and also as family pets continue to age.
In the domestic pet toiletry business, for dogs, the Company has endeavored to revitalize the market by
launching Manner Wear for Female Dogs following on from Manner Wear for Male Dogs, which are special
clothes for dogs designed to meet the growing need for excretion care while taking pets outside, and also
enhancing the scent of the Deo Sheet Soft Scented Deodorizing Design Sheets, which feature a stylish design.
Meanwhile for cats, the Company has launched Deo Toilet Funwari Scent Anti-bacterial Sand Eliminates
Odor for One Week, which eliminates the smell of a cat’s excretion every time the cat covers it with sand, and
has improved the system toilet by producing it in a shape that allows for easier excretion. In these and other
ways, the Company has been pursuing ways to make the lives of pets and their owners more comfortable and
convenient.
In the domestic pet food market, for dogs, in addition to enhancing its range of side treats to help keep dogs
healthy, the Company has been working to eliminate the concerns of owners about food for smaller dogs by
launching the world’s first* microwavable Warm Kitchen series, along with releasing products containing
domestically produced chicken breast meat and other ingredients. Meanwhile, for cats, the Company has
enhanced its range of products for aging pets, and has been working to create a high added-value market.
In the North American market, in addition to growth in sales of its flea and tick pesticides in line with demand
seasons, sales have remained steady in sheets for dogs and lightweight-type cat litter products. The Company
has also steadily expanded sales of wet-type snacks for cats, which is a first of its kind in America.
As a result, net sales and segment income (operating income) for the pet care business for the fiscal year under
review were ¥ 85,624 million and ¥ 3,329 million, respectively.
* Among major global brands, as a semi-perishable dog food containing fats and processed starch treated by
etherification, to be heated in a microwave oven (as researched by Unicharm Corporation in March 2015).

In light of the management environment surrounding the Company and its group companies, we anticipate
further market growth to continue in Asian countries where business is being rolled out. Meanwhile in Japan,
although the government’s economic policies are expected to facilitate a pick-up in business, faltering
consumer confidence following the consumption tax rate hike and other factors are still weighing on the
economy; hence, business conditions are forecast to remain uncertain.
Overseas, we intend to grow with a speed exceeding that of the market and strive for vitalization through
offering products that meet individual needs in the target countries and aggressive sales activities.
In Japan, we continue to offer high value-added products reflecting consumer needs and lead the
revitalization of the domestic market in the personal care business area.
In the pet care business, the Company will respond to the increasing pet-related demand by working to
develop products linked to the four major trends among Japanese pet owners: “indoor pet keeping,”
“popularity of small dogs,” “aging of pets,” and “pet obesity,” and also by revitalizing the market.
As a result of the aforementioned efforts, net sales, operating income, ordinary income and net income for
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 are projected to be ¥777,000 million, ¥87,000 million, ¥80,000
million and ¥47,000 million, respectively, on a consolidated basis. Net income per share will be ¥78.90.
In the meantime, the Company’s assumptions on foreign exchange rates for the main currencies are
JPY118.50 to the U.S. dollar and JPY17.90 to the Chinese yuan.

(Note) The previous period (fiscal year ended December 31, 2014) is an irregular settlement of accounts due to
changes in the accounting period. As a result, increases or decreases in cash flow over the previous fiscal
year are omitted.
Total assets as of the end of the fiscal year under review were ¥702,601 million, up ¥3,492 million year on
year. This was mainly due to an increase of ¥7,019 million in machinery, equipment and vehicles (net), and
an increase of ¥6,912 million in notes and accounts receivable - trade. Meanwhile, deferred tax assets
decreased by ¥5,117 million, and goodwill also fell by ¥4,788 million.
Total liabilities were ¥251,509 million, up ¥45,244 million year on year. This was mainly due to an increase
of ¥54,421 million in convertible bond-type bonds with subscription rights to shares, an increase of ¥6,077
million in deferred tax liabilities, and an increase of ¥5,337 million in long-term loans payable. Meanwhile,
short-term loans payable decreased by ¥24,132 million.
Net assets were ¥451,091 million, down ¥41,752 million year on year. This was mainly due to a decrease of
¥39,499 million in capital surplus, among other factors.
Consequently, the ratio of shareholders’ equity decreased from 60.0% as of the end of the preceding fiscal
year to 55.1% as of the end of the fiscal year under review.
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled ¥85,009 million due to ¥77,340 million in income before
income taxes and minority interests, ¥ 27,343 million in depreciation, ¥14,959 million in income taxes paid
and a ¥12,315 million increase (decrease) in notes and accounts receivable - trade.
Net cash used in investing activities totaled ¥68,166 million as a result of ¥46,575 million in the purchase of
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, ¥36,035 million in payments into time deposits, ¥9,280
million in proceeds from withdrawal of time deposits, and ¥4,467 million in proceeds from sales of
investment securities.
Net cash used in financing activities amounted to ¥36,835 million due to ¥54,750 million in proceeds from
issuance of convertible bond-type bonds with subscription rights to shares, ¥50,742 million in payments
from changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in change in scope of consolidation,
¥22,200 million in repayments of long-term loans payable, and ¥13,000 million in purchase of treasury
shares, among other factors.
As a result, cash and cash equivalents at end of period amounted to ¥101,966 million, down ¥25,078 million
over the end of the preceding fiscal year.

Note 4: Interest-bearing debts cover all debts for which interest is paid among those that are included in the
consolidated balance sheet.
(3) Basic policy regarding profit distribution and dividends for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2016
The Company recognizes that one of its most important management policies is to return profits to
shareholders, and it is striving to increase corporate value by generating cash flows to achieve this goal. In
addition, the Company will aim to achieve 15% or higher ROE (return on equity) and maintain its policy of
increasing dividend payments in a stable and continuous manner in terms of both cash flow and profit, while
making efforts to aggressively expand business investment for strengthening and growing corporate structure
to improve profitability.
The annual dividend for the fiscal year under review will be ¥14.8, comprising a year-end dividend of ¥7.4
per share, in addition to a ¥7.4 per share dividend for the end of the second quarter. This will be the 14th
consecutive period of an increase in dividends, with a dividend on equity rate (DOE) of 2.2%.
Also, based on the resolution for acquisition of the treasury shares passed at the Board of Directors’ meeting
held on September 8, 2015, from September 9 to November 17, 2015 (contracted base), 5,484,100 shares
were acquired by the “purchase on the Tokyo Stock Exchange” for the total acquisition amount of ¥12,999
million.
In regard to our shareholder return policy for the next fiscal year and onwards, we will make stable and
ongoing dividend payments based on medium- and long-term consolidated earnings growth, while
prioritizing business investments to realize continual growth. We are targeting a total shareholder return of
50% for both shareholder dividends and the acquisition of treasury shares, by flexibly acquiring treasury
shares as required.
Based on the abovementioned profit distribution policy, we plan to make an annual dividend payment in the
next fiscal year of ¥16.0 per share, including a ¥8.0 per share dividend for the end of the second quarter.

2. Management Policy
(1) Basic management policy of the Company
The Unicharm Group has established the management philosophy that “we contribute to creating a better
quality of life for everyone by offering only the finest products and services to the market and customers, both
at home in Japan and abroad,” and it will strive to consistently create new value and promote corporate
activities with the aim of ensuring the best value for its stakeholders, specifically its customers, shareholders,
business partners, associates and society.
(2) Targeted business indicators
The Company aims to develop a management structure with high capital efficiency that enables it to survive
the global competition through continuous growth in sales and profit, as well as increase in ROE.
(3) Medium- and long-term management strategy of the Company
The Company and its group companies are currently implementing the Ninth Medium-Term Management Plan
for the three fiscal years from April 2014 to December 2016. The details of this Plan are described in the
“Fiscal Year 2014 Unicharm Presentation Materials for Investor Meeting” released on April 30, 2014.
These materials can be accessed at the following URL.
Website of the Company:
http://www.unicharm.co.jp/english/ir/library/investors/index.html
(4) Issues facing the Group
As for overseas operations, the global economy is showing signs of steady growth and high levels of economic
growth are expected to continue primarily in emerging countries in Asia. However, economic, financial and
social conditions are causing fluctuations in the exchange rates of some emerging countries where we are
rolling out business; this is considerably impacting business in these countries and raising concerns over the
risk of price fluctuations in imported raw materials and products. Meanwhile in Japan, in addition to a sense of
uncertainty about the direction of the economy, the rising prices of imported raw materials resulting from a
weaker yen are causing anxiety in the fiercely competitive sales environment. The personal care business is
also forecast to see a decline going forward in the target population for baby care and feminine care products.
In the midst of such issues, in accordance with the management philosophy of the Company and its group
companies, we will strive to consistently create new value and speedily promote the expansion of product
line-ups to meet customer needs. As for overseas, we will enhance our risk management while aggressively
developing business areas and establishing our position as a category leader in growth markets; and in Japan
we will expand our business by revitalizing the market. In these ways, the Company is striving to improve its
business performance.
In order to further promote corporate reform in the future, in all businesses we will place greater emphasis on
increasing added value through continuous product innovation, and thoroughly pursue cost reduction and the
efficient use of management resources.

3. Basic Stance on Selecting Accounting Standards
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with the accounting standards of
Japan.
Henceforth, for the purpose of improving the international comparability of financial information, we will
continue to consider preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Group in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including the timing of adopting IFRS.

(5) Notes to consolidated financial statements
(Note regarding the Company’s position as a going concern)
Not applicable
(Material accounting policies concerning the preparation of consolidated financial statements)
Matters related to the scope of consolidation
Number of consolidated subsidiaries: 46
(Change in accounting policies)
(Application of Accounting Standard for Business Combinations, etc.)
The Accounting Standard for Business Combinations (ASBJ Statement No. 21, September 13, 2013;
hereinafter, “Business Combinations Accounting Standard”), Accounting Standard for Consolidated
Financial Statements” (ASBJ Statement No.22, September 13, 2013; hereinafter, “Consolidated Financial
Statements Accounting Standard”), and “Accounting Standard for Business Divestitures” (ASBJ Statement
No. 7, September 13, 2013; hereinafter, “Business Divestitures Accounting Standard”) and related standards
are made applicable to the fiscal year under review starting April 1, 2014 and onwards.
These accounting standards (except the provisions of Paragraph 39 of Consolidated Financial Statements
Accounting Standard) have now been applied early, effective from the fiscal year under review. Under this
new application of these standards, differences caused by changes in the Company’s equity in the
subsidiaries and affiliates with controlling interests will be adjusted in capital surplus, and acquisition-related
expenses shall be all reported as expenses accruing during the consolidated fiscal year in which said
acquisition takes place.
As to business combinations to take place after April 1, 2015, i.e. the beginning of the first quarter of the
fiscal year under review, appraisal of the purchase price allocation, pursuant to the final determination of
provisional accounting treatments, will now be changed so that it is reflected in the consolidated financial
statements where the date of the business combination falls.
The implementation of Business Combinations Accounting Standard and its related standards is subject to
the transitional treatments stipulated in the provisions of Article 58-2 (4) of Accounting Standard for
Business Combinations, Article 44-5 (4) of Accounting Standard for Consolidated Financial Statements, and
Article 57-4 (4) of Accounting Standard for Business Divestitures, and has been and will be underway since
the beginning of the first quarter of the fiscal year under review and going forward.
The effect of this change is a decrease of ¥39,426 million in capital surplus at the end of the fiscal year under
review. The effect of this change on per share information is listed in the relevant section.
In the consolidated statement of cash flows of the fiscal year under review, cash flows related to the purchase
or sale of shares of subsidiaries not corresponding to changes in the scope of consolidation are recorded
under “Cash flows from financing activities.” Cash flows related to expenses accrued from the purchase of
shares of subsidiaries corresponding to changes in the scope of consolidation, and expenses accrued from the
purchase or sale of shares of subsidiaries not corresponding to changes in the scope of consolidation, are
recorded under “Cash flows from operating activities.”
(Changes in presentation methods)
(Consolidated statement of income)
In the consolidated previous fiscal year, “Subsidy income,” “Gain on sales of scraps” and “Gain on forfeiture
of unclaimed dividends,” which were indicated in “Other” under “Non-operating income,” are stated
independently from the fiscal year under review, as they have become significant in terms of amount.
As a result of these changes in presentation methods, the consolidated financial statements of the previous
fiscal year have been reclassified. Subsequently, in the consolidated statement of income for the previous
fiscal year, the amount of ¥2,016 million, which was indicated in “Other” under “Non-operating income,”
has been reclassified as ¥373 million under “Subsidy income,” ¥543 million under “Gain on sales of
scraps,” ¥8 million under “Gain on forfeiture of unclaimed dividends,” and ¥1,091 million under “Other.”

(Consolidated statement of cash flows)
In the consolidated previous fiscal year, “Loss (gain) on sales and retirement of property, plant and
equipment” of the independently stated “Cash flows from operating activities” and “Loss (gain) on sales and
retirement of intangible assets” was indicated in “Other.” Based on a review of the items for presentation
from the perspective of clarity, starting from the fiscal year under review, these items will now be presented
as “Loss (gain) on sales and retirement of non-current assets.”
As a result of these changes in presentation methods, the consolidated financial statements for the previous
fiscal year have been reclassified. Subsequently, the amounts of ¥498 million under “Loss (gain) on sales
and retirement of property, plant and equipment” under “Cash flows from operating activities,” and ¥10
million under “Loss (gain) on sales and retirement of intangible assets,” which was indicated in “Other” for
the previous fiscal year, have been reclassified as ¥508 million under “Loss (gain) on sales and retirement of
non-current assets.”
In the previous consolidated fiscal year, “Purchase of property, plant and equipment,” “Purchase of
intangible assets” and “Proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment” were indicated in the
independently stated “Cash flows from investing activities.” Based on a review of the items for presentation
from the perspective of clarity, starting from the fiscal year under review, these items will now be presented
as “Purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets” and “Proceeds from sales of property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets.”
As a result of these changes in presentation methods, the consolidated financial statements of the previous
fiscal year have been reclassified. Subsequently, the amounts of ¥(42,303) million under “Purchase of
property, plant and equipment,” ¥(360) million under “Purchase of intangible assets” and ¥879 million under
“Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment,” which were indicated in “Cash flows from
investing activities” for the previous fiscal year, have been reclassified as ¥(42,664) million under “Purchase
of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets” and ¥879 million under “Proceeds from sales of
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.”
(Additional information)
(Revision of amounts of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities due to changes in corporate tax rate, etc.)
The Act for Partial Revision of the Income Tax Act, etc. (Act No. 9 of 2015) and the Act for Partial Revision
of Local Taxes, etc. (Act No. 2 of 2015) were promulgated on March 31, 2015, and as a result, the corporate
tax rate, etc. will be lowered beginning with the consolidated fiscal years beginning on or after April 1, 2015.
Accordingly, the effective statutory tax rates used to measure deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities
will be changed from 35.64% to 33.06% for temporary differences expected to be eliminated in the fiscal
years beginning on or after January 1, 2016. Additionally, the effective statutory tax rate used to measure
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will be changed to 32.26% for temporary differences expected
to be eliminated in the fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
As a result of this change in the tax rate, the amount of deferred tax assets (after deducting deferred tax
liabilities) decreased by ¥989 million, the amount of deferred income taxes increased by ¥1,235 million,
valuation differences on available-for-sale securities increased by ¥542 million and remeasurments of
defined benefit plans decreased by ¥296 million.

products, and clean-and-fresh products in the “personal care business.” In the “pet care business,” the
Company has manufactured and sold pet food products and pet toiletry products. In “other
businesses,” the Company has manufactured and sold business-use products, etc.
