USER GUIDE

Agreements drafted by the legal experts of Global Negotiator cover all relevant aspects that
are negotiated and agreed in the different types of business between companies. However,
when these agreements are used you should take into account some recommendations
common to all of them that are described in this User Guide.
DATE
The date when the agreement comes into force is the one that appears in its header, as
mentioned in the final paragraphs of the agreement, before signatures (This Agreement comes
into force on the date written above).
In some agreements -for example in the Supply Agreement- the date of coming into force is
also mentioned in one of the clauses. In these cases you have to verify that the two dates
inserted in the agreement (in the heading and in the corresponding clause) are the same, in
order to avoid discrepancies.
PARTIES
Be sure to insert in the first page of the agreement the full details of the Parties:


When a Party is a company you must insert the following information: legal name, legal
form (limited, incorporated, etc.), full address, registration data and fiscal identification
number.



When a Party is an individual that works as independent professional (for example a
commercial agent) you must insert the following information: full name, profession, full
address and fiscal identification number.

CLAUSES
Clauses with different alternatives: choose the most favorable
In the most important clauses of each agreement (exclusivity, payment terms, applicable law
and competent jurisdiction, etc.) several drafting alternatives are proposed so you can choose
the most appropriate to each situation. Therefore, the user before submitting the agreement
to the other Party must choose the alternatives that seem best suited to their interests, and
eliminate the rest.
Clauses with blank spaces to be completed
In several clauses of the agreement blank spaces appear with dots (.......................) that the
user has to complete inserting text. Following the dots, between brackets, you will see the
data and explanations to insert the text.

3



When the text between brackets is in normal letters (the same as the agreement) and
separated by "," or the word "o", the user must insert one of the options suggested.

Example of blank space (........) with options to select between brackets:
Orders handled before completion of the present Agreement which produce sales transactions
within .......... [1, 2, 3, 6] months shall entitle the Agent to receive the corresponding commission.
In this case the user must choose between options 1, 2, 3 or 6 months and insert one in the blank
space (........).


When the text between brackets is in italics the user has to insert the data and information
requested and eliminate the bracketed text.

Example of blank space - (.........) to insert text:
Both parties, by mutual consent, resolve to refer any dispute to the Rules of Conciliation and
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed
in accordance with said Rules. The place of arbitration shall be ........... [city and country]. In this
case the user must insert in the blank space (...........) the city and country chosen to conduct
the arbitration and afterwards eliminate the bracketed text [city and country].
Notices Clause
Sometimes it may happen that the official address of the Parties which appear at the beginning
of the agreement is different from which is to be used for communications between the
Parties during the terms of the agreement. In this case the user should include at the end of
the agreement a Notices Clause.
Example of Notices Clause:
Notices. - In order to comply with their contractual obligations, the Parties establish the
following address for the provision of notices related to this agreement:
- Party 1 ............................................................. [insert full address].
- Party 2 ............................................................. [insert full address].

ANNEXES
The agreements incorporate some Annexes, each of them, referenced to the corresponding
Clause. Annexes are drafted in commonly used formats, although the user must adapt these
formats and the text inserted in them to each particular situation.
SIGNATURES
People who sign
Persons signing the agreement on behalf of the company must have the authority to do so and
preferably, be entitled on the basis of a power of attorney. Below the signature, in addition to
the full name of the person that signs his/her position must be inserted. When one of the
Parties who signs is a natural person (for example a commercial agent in a Agency Agreement)
obviously he or she is the person that has to sign the agreement.

The laws of some countries require that agreements, to be valid, shall be signed in front of
witnesses or a public notary. Therefore, before signing a agreement you should be informed
about the requirements that may exist in each country.
Place and date of signature
Usually agreements are signed by both Parties on the same date and place. Nevertheless, in
international agreements, due to physical distance, it is common that each of the Parties sign
in different dates and places. This agreement provides for both alternatives so it comes to
choosing the most appropriate to each situation.
Number of copies
Usually, the Parties sign two copies of the agreement, each Party retaining one of them, but cal
also arise the need to sign more copies. In this case all you have to do is mention explicitly the
number of copies to be signed in the paragraph that is included at the end of the agreement
(Both Parties declare their conformity to the present agreement, which is signed in ...... copies,
each of which shall be considered an original).

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
The Parties must sign all pages of the agreement, including Annexes, so they are also valid. It is
better to use ball point or pen (not pencil) in a color other than black (e.g.: blue); this makes it
easier to distinguish an original document from a photocopy.
It is preferable (although no mandatory) to express sums of money and percentages in words
and figures. Of course, the words and figures for a given amount must match exactly. You also
must insert the currency in which the amounts are expressed. It is advisable to use the rules
establish by ISO that name each currency by three capital letters (EUR for euro, USD for dollar,
GBP for sterling pound, JPY for Japanese yen, etc. - you can get the acronyms of every currency
in the website www.oanda.com).
Once you have chosen the best alternatives of each clause and have completed the blank
spaces you should revise the whole agreement to remove remaining paragraphs and correct
any errors.
