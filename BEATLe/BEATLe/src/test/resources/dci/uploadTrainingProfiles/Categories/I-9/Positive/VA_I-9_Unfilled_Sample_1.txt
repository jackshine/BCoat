Form I-9, Employment

Department of Homeland Security

Instructions
Please read all instructions carefully before completing this form.

Anti-Discrimination Notice. It is illegal to discriminate against
any individual (other than an alien not authorized to work in the
U.S.) in hiring, discharging, or recruiting or referring for a fee
because of that individual's national origin or citizenship status. It
is illegal to discriminate against work eligible individuals.
Employers CANNOT specify which document(s) they will accept
from an employee. The refusal to hire an individual because the
documents presented have a future expiration date may also
constitute illegal discrimination.

What Is the Purpose of This Form?
The purpose of this form is to document that each new
employee (both citizen and non-citizen) hired after November
6, 1986 is authorized to work in the United States.

When Should the Form I-9 Be Used?
All employees, citizens and noncitizens, hired after November
6, 1986 and working in the United States must complete a
Form I-9.

Filling Out the Form I-9
Section 1, Employee: This part of the form must be
completed at the time of hire, which is the actual beginning of
employment. Providing the Social Security number is
voluntary, except for employees hired by employers
participating in the USCIS Electronic Employment Eligibility
Verification Program (E-Verify). The employer is
responsible for ensuring that Section 1 is timely and
properly completed.
Preparer/Translator Certification. The Preparer/Translator
Certification must be completed if Section 1 is prepared by a
person other than the employee. A preparer/translator may be
used only when the employee is unable to complete Section 1
on his/her own. However, the employee must still sign
Section 1 personally.
Section 2, Employer: For the purpose of completing this
form, the term "employer" means all employers including
those recruiters and referrers for a fee who are agricultural
associations, agricultural employers or farm labor contractors.
Employers must complete Section 2 by examining evidence
of identity and employment eligibility within three (3)
business days of the date employment begins. If employees
are authorized to work, but are unable to present the required

document(s) within three business days, they must present a
receipt for the application of the document(s) within three
business days and the actual document(s) within ninety (90)
days. However, if employers hire individuals for a duration of
less than three business days, Section 2 must be completed at
the time employment begins. Employers must record:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Document title;
Issuing authority;
Document number;
Expiration date, if any; and
The date employment begins.

Employers must sign and date the certification. Employees
must present original documents. Employers may, but are not
required to, photocopy the document(s) presented. These
photocopies may only be used for the verification process and
must be retained with the Form I-9. However, employers are
still responsible for completing and retaining the Form I-9.
Section 3, Updating and Reverification: Employers must
complete Section 3 when updating and/or reverifying the Form
I-9. Employers must reverify employment eligibility of their
employees on or before the expiration date recorded in Section
1. Employers CANNOT specify which document(s) they will
accept from an employee.
A. If an employee's name has changed at the time this
form is being updated/reverified, complete Block A.
B. If an employee is rehired within three (3) years of the
date this form was originally completed and the
employee is still eligible to be employed on the same
basis as previously indicated on this form (updating),
complete Block B and the signature block.
C. If an employee is rehired within three (3) years of the
date this form was originally completed and the
employee's work authorization has expired or if a
current employee's work authorization is about to
expire (reverification), complete Block B and:
1. Examine any document that reflects that the
employee is authorized to work in the U.S. (see
List A or C);
2. Record the document title, document number and
expiration date (if any) in Block C, and
3. Complete the signature block.

Paperwork Reduction Act
We try to create forms and instructions that are accurate, can
be easily understood and which impose the least possible
burden on you to provide us with information. Often this is
difficult because some immigration laws are very complex.
Accordingly, the reporting burden for this collection of
information is computed as follows: 1) learning about this
form, and completing the form, 9 minutes; 2) assembling and
filing (recordkeeping) the form, 3 minutes, for an average of
12 minutes per response. If you have comments regarding the
accuracy of this burden estimate, or suggestions for making
this form simpler, you can write to: U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services, Regulatory Management Division, 111
Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., 3rd Floor, Suite 3008,
Washington, DC 20529. OMB No. 1615-0047.

The Form I-9 may be signed and retained electronically, as
authorized in Department of Homeland Security regulations

Privacy Act Notice
The authority for collecting this information is the
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-603
(8 USC 1324a).
This information is for employers to verify the eligibility of
individuals for employment to preclude the unlawful hiring, or
recruiting or referring for a fee, of aliens who are not
authorized to work in the United States.
This information will be used by employers as a record of
their basis for determining eligibility of an employee to work
in the United States. The form will be kept by the employer
and made available for inspection by officials of U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Department of Labor
and Office of Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair
Employment Practices.

EMPLOYERS MUST RETAIN COMPLETED FORM I-9
