Cautionary Statement to Owners Obtaining Building Permits
101.65(lr) of the Wisconsin Statutes requires municipalities that enforce the Uniform Dwelling Code to
provide an owner who applies for a building permit with a statement advising the owner that:
If the owner hires a contractor to perform work under the building permit and the contractor is not bonded
or insured as required under s. 101.654 (2) (a), the following consequences might occur:
(a) The owner may be held liable for any bodily inquiry to or death of others or for any damage to
the property of others that arises out of the work performed under the building permit or that is caused by
any negligence by the contractor that occurs in connection with the work performed under the building
permit.
(b) The owner may not be able to collect from the contractor damages for any loss sustained by
the owner because of a violation by the contractor of the one- and two- family dwelling code or an
ordinance enacted under sub. (1) (a), because of any bodily injury to or death of others or damage to the
property of others that arises out of the work performed under the building permit or because of any
bodily injury to or death of others or damage to the property of others that is caused by any negligence by
the contractor that occurs in connection with the work performed under the building permit.

other penalties or costs. For more information, visit the Department of Natural Resources wetlands
