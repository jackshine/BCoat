3.10.2Retrieving and storing event objects
The framework has to guarantee that we are able to retrieve and store data objects from the persistent
storage:
• An Algorithm is asking the EventDataSvc for an object with a given identifier. If the object is not
in the transient event store, i.e. it has not been registered previously, it will trigger an action on
the EvtPersistencySvc.
• The EventDataSvc knows the “persistent address” of the required object because either it has the
root from where the object is hanging or the address has been deduced from the identifier. It also
knows the “type” of requested object from the root. Therefore, it uses this information to request
to the EvtPersistencySvc to load the object.
• The EvtPersistencySvc selects the appropriate Converter from a set of Converters that have been
declared at initialization by using the “type”. The Converter is called and locates the object in the
persistent store and creates a transient representation of the same object initialized with the
information of the persistent. It also fills the references of the new object to the other event or
detector data objects using the EventDataSvc or DetectorDataSvc.
• The new created data object is then registered by the EvtPersistencySvc and makes it available to
the Algorithm that requested it.
• Storing transient data objects after the processing is done following a similar collaboration
between the EvtPersistencySvc, EventDataSvc and the adequate Converter.
3.10.3Detector data synchronization
The detector data must be kept synchronized with the event which is currently being processed. This
is essential since the calibration, alignment and environmental data may change at any moment
during the execution of the job.
• When a new event root is loaded in the transient event store, the DetectorDataSvc is informed by
the ApplicationMgr together with the information of the event time.
• Each data object in the transient detector store has a validity time range. Assuming that the
events are ordered in time (this simplifies the case), the DetectorDataSvc compares the current
event time with the next time that any data becomes invalid.
• For most of the events, there is no action to be done since generally the validity ranges cover
many events. But in some cases, the DetectorDataSvc will scan all the transient detector store and
look for objects that need to be updated.
• The update of the object is done by the DetPersistencySvc which has the knowledge of how to
find the new object in question knowing the event time.
• The object members are updated without the need to delete and create new objects. In this way
references to them are still valid, so Algorithms can just use them without the need of knowing
that a new calibration or alignment is being used.

3.11 Physical Design
For large software systems, such as ours, it is clearly important to decompose the system
into hierarchies of smaller more manageable components.This decomposition of the system
can have important consequences for implementation related issues, such as compile-time
coupling, link-time dependencies, size of executables etc. The architecture must therefore
take into account physical design issues as well as the logical structure.
Physical design focuses on the physical structure of the system. A physical component is the
smallest unit of physical design and may contain several classes that together cooperate to
provide some higher level functionality. However larger systems require hierarchical
physical organization beyond the hierarchy of components. This can be achieved by
grouping related components together into a cohesive physical unit, which we call a
package. The notation used to represent packages follows that of Lakos [5] and is shown in
Illustration 3.8. Dependencies between packages reflect the overall dependencies among the
components comprising each subsystem.
A package is a collection of components that have a cohesive semantic purpose. It might
also consist of a loosely coupled collection of low-level re-usable components, such as STL.
In general the dependencies between packages are acyclic (cyclic dependencies should be
avoided at all costs). Physically a package consists of a number of header files and a single
library file.
Organizing software in terms of packages has several advantages:
• each package can be owned and authored by a single developer
• acceptable dependencies can be specified, and approved by the system architect, as part
of the overall system design
• highly coupled parts of the system can be assigned to a single package which makes
change management easier
• packaging aids incremental comprehension, testing and reuse
A design goal of physical design is to minimize the number of package dependencies
(Illustration 3.8 gives an example) which is done for the following reasons:
• improves usability i.e. do not link huge libraries just to use simple functions
• reduces number of libraries that must be linked
• minimizes size of executable image
Dependencies can be minimized by repackaging components e.g. by escalating a
component from a lower to a higher level.
Usability is enhanced by minimizing the number of header files that are exported. Header
files are exported only if a client of the package needs access to the functionality provided
by that component.
Physical design also addresses issues related to the management of the code repository and
release mechanism. The directory structure directly supports the organization of packages
and, the allocation of files to subdirectories depends on whether interfaces of components
are public or private.

Application Manager
The Application Manager (ApplicationMgr) is the component that steers the execution of
the data processing application. There is only one instance of ApplicationMgr per
application.
In this chapter we will describe the functionality of this component, the interfaces it offers to
other components and its dependencies.

Application Manager
36 GAUDI
4.1 Purpose and Functionality
The main purpose of the Application Manager (ApplicationMgr) is to steer any data processing
application. This includes all data processing applications for LHCb data at all stages: simulation,
reconstruction, analysis, high level triggers, etc. Specific implementations of the ApplicationMgr will
be developed to cope with the different environments (on-line, off-line, interactive, batch, etc.). The
ApplicationMgr implements the following functionality:
• The event loop. For traditional batch processing applications it implements the “event loop”. It
initializes all the components and services of the application. In particular it initializes the event
selector component with the selection criteria for the current job (which events need to be
processed, etc.). Then it requests the processing services of all the relevant processing elements
(Algorithms) for each event. Finally, it informs all the components when the job is done to allow
them to perform the necessary actions at the end of job (saving histograms, job statistics, etc.).
• Bootstraping the application. The ApplicationMgr is in charge of creating all the services and
processing components (Algorithms) needed to provide the desired functionality. The concrete
type of these components depending on the persistent object store, user interface system, etc. is
selected at run time based on the job options.
• Service & Algorithm information center. It maintains a directory of the major Services and
Algorithms which have been created by it directly or indirectly. It allows other components to
locate the requested service based on a name.
4.2 Interfaces
The ApplicationMgr provides the following interfaces:
• Service locator (ISvcLocator). Algorithms and services may ask the ApplicationMgr for
references to existing services belonging to the application. For example, to get a reference to the
MessageSvc which is needed by the Algorithm in order to output an error message.
• User interface (IAppMgrUI). Interface to the user interface to allow the user to interact with the
application. This interface is necessary for non-batch oriented applications.
• Properties interface (IProperty). This interface allows other components to modify the default
behavior of the ApplicationMgr by setting new values to properties. This interface is the same
interface implemented by the Algorithms and other components.

4.3 Dependencies
The ApplicationMgr depends on the following services provided by other components of the
architecture:
• Job options service (JobOptionsSvc). The JobOptionsSvc service provides to the ApplicationMgr
the new values for its properties in case the user would like to overwrite the default ones. These
properties may drive the choice of the persistent mechanism, the algorithms which need to be
instantiated, the output stream for error messages, etc.
• Message service (MessageSvc). The ApplicationMgr uses the MessageSvc to report errors and
informational messages to the end user.
• Algorithm factory (AlgorithmFactory). The ApplicationMgr uses the AlgorithmFactory service to
create (instantiate) the concrete implementations of the Algorithm. In that way, the
ApplicationMgr does not need to be changed when new algorithms are introduced into the
system.
• Algorithms. Algorithms do the real physics data processing work.
• Event selector (EventSelector). The ApplicationMgr uses the event selector to generate the set of
events which will processed by the application.
GAUDI 39

Algorithms
The Algorithm component is the support structure for real computational code. Any code
that a user would like to be executed within the framework must conform to the Algorithm
component specification1. This code may be for detector simulation, track reconstruction,
calorimeter cluster finding, analysis of B-decays or whatever. In practice ensuring this
conformity will be implemented by providing an Algorithm base class which must be
extended to form concrete algorithms. A general algorithm has properties or parameters
which tune the computation, one or more sources of input data, and one or more sources of
output data.
In this chapter we describe the Algorithm base class from which all concrete algorithms
must inherit. This interface allows the end-user to assemble and configure complex
applications using basic algorithms as building blocks.

Algorithms
40 GAUDI
5.1 Purpose and Functionality
The purpose of a concrete algorithm is to convert a set of input data into a set of output data. The
actual computation depends upon the specific algorithm and also upon the values of any internal
parameters which may be set, for example, by the job options service.
Algorithms may only request data from the transient data services, e.g. the eventDataSvc, they know
nothing of the persistent world. Similarly any data produced by an algorithm which is to be passed
onto another algorithm or which is to be made persistent must be registed in one of these stores.
An algorithm may be executed once per event, or many times per event. For some types of algorithm
it may be interesting to execute them only in response to certain events, e.g. when the run changes or
when the current job is finished. Algorithms may be executed directly by the application manager or,
if nested, by the parent algorithm.
5.2 Interfaces
The Algorithm provides the following interfaces:
• Execution interface (IAlgorithm). It is through this interface that algorithm configuration and
execution is performed.
• Properties interface (IProperty). The Properties interface provides a hook to allow the setting of
the internal attributes of a concrete algorithm
5.3 Dependencies
The Algorithm depends on the following services provided by other components of the architecture:
• Job options service (JobOptionsSvc). The JobOptionsSvc service provides to the Algorithm the
new values for its properties in case the user would like to overwrite the default ones. These
properties may change the internal behavior of the Algorithm.
• Event data service (EventDataSvc). The Algorithm used the EventDataSvc to get access to the
data objects it needs to perform its function.
• Message service (MessageSvc). The Algorithm may need to send messages reporting its progress
or errors occurring either for debugging or logging.
• Algorithm factory (AlgorithmFactory). The Algorithm uses the AlgorithmFactory service to
create (instantiated) the concrete implementations of other Algorithms.
• Algorithms. The Algorithm may use other smaller algorithms to implement its function.
• Other services like EvtPersistecySvc, EventSelector, etc. are initialized by the ApplicationMgr in

Data Converter
A data Converter is responsible for translating data objects from one representation into
another. Concrete examples are e.g. converters creating transient objects representing parts
of an event from the persistent (and disk based) representations, or converters creating a
textual representation of data objects for printing to the alphanumeric terminal. Specific
Converters will be to be needed for each data type that needs to be converted. Any code that
a user needs to execute for converting data objects from one representation into another
must conform to the Converter component specification. In practice ensuring this
conformity will be implemented by providing an Converter base class which must be
extended to form concrete converters.
In this chapter we describe the Converter base class from which all concrete converters
must inherit.

Data Converter
44 GAUDI
6.1 Purpose and Functionality
The data converters are responsible for translating data from one representation into another.
Concrete examples are e.g. converters creating transient objects from their persistent (disk based)
representations. Converters will have to deal with the technology both representations are based on:
in the upper example they have to know about the database internals as well as the structure of the
transient representations. The converters know about the mechanism to retrieve persistent objects
(ZEBRA, Objectivity, …) and only pass abstract instances of the converted objects, hence shielding
the calling service from internals.
Data converters are meant to be light. This means there will not be all-in-one converters, which are
able to convert the “world”, but rather many converters, each able to create a representation of a given
type.
In order to function a converter must be able to
• Answer (when asked) which kind of representation the converter is able to create and on which
kind of data store the source representation of the object resides.
• Retrieve the source object from the source store.
• Create the requested transient representation using the information contained in the source object.
• Initialize pointers in the transient representation of the created object.
• Update the transient representation using the information contained in the source object.
• Update pointers in the transient representation of the created object.
• Convert the transient representation to its target (e.g. persistent) representation.
• Resolve references within the target representation (persistent references).
• Update the target representation from the transient representation.
• Update references within the target representation (persistent references).
The conversion/creation mechanism of an object into another representation is a two step process:
• Firstly the raw object will be translated. This does not include any links pointing to other objects.
• At the second step the link will be converted.
Concrete user converters are based on a base class which deals with the technology specific actions.
The concrete converters hence only deal with data internal to the objects, e.g.
• Resolving pointers of the transient objects to objects in the detector description.
• Fill/update contained entries in the persistent representation which will not be identifiable by the
persistent store.
• The base class is in charge of resolving the generic “identifiable” references as they are accessible
from the directory of the transient DataObject. It is understood, that there is a correspondence
between the identifiable entries e.g. in the transient world and the persistent world.

n the implementation of specific converters.
• Message service (MessageSvc). The Converter uses the MessageSvc to report errors and
informational messages to the end user.
• The data storage technology: Converters will have to deal with specific data stores like ZEBRA,
Objectivity etc.

Job Options Service
The purpose of the job options service is to supply the options for the current job to other
components of the architecture. It is assumed that facilities allowing the user to edit the
options and to save or retrieve sets of them for future use are supplied outside this service.

48 GAUDI
7.1 Purpose and Functionality
The purpose of the job options service is to supply the options for the current job to other components
of the architecture. It is assumed that facilities allowing the user to edit the options and to save or
retrieve sets of them for future use are supplied outside this service.
The options may consist of:
• Flags that select the algorithms to be run in the current job.
• Values that override default properties of the algorithms
• Definition of the input data set
• Selection criteria for the input data
• Definition of output data streams (e.g. for event data, histogram data etc.)
• Definition of error reporting streams
• Etc.
A set of options is identified by the name of the set (SetName) (For example SetName could be the
full pathname of a file if the options are contained in a text file, or the identifier of a set in the options
database)
An option modifies the properties of a client. Each option consists of:
• The name of the client (ClientName) to whose properties will be modified by this option.
• The name of the property to be modified (PropertyName)
• The new value (or values) of the property (PropertyValues) (T = bool, int, double, string )
7.2 Interfaces
The JobOptionsSvc provides the following interfaces:
• Query options interface (IQueryOptions). This interface exposes the functionality of the
JobOptionsSvc. It provides the following methods:
• configure( string SetName ) This method allows a client to specify which set of job options is
to be used in the current context. Usually this will be used only once per job when
JobOptionsSvc is created.
• setMyProperties( IProperty *me, string ClientName ) This method is used by a client who
wants to override the default values of its properties with those described in the job options.
The client must implement the IProperty interface, which will be used by setMyProperties to
set the client's properties.
• getOption( string ClientName, string PropertyName, vector<T> PropertyValues) This
method allows clients to retrieve the job option which modifies a given property of a given
client in the current context, if that option exists.

A given PropertyName can occur only once for a given ClientName. This implies that different
instances of a client class must have a different ClientName if they need different PropertyValues for
a given PropertyName.
The JobOptionsSvc depends on the following services provided by other components of the
architecture:
• ApplicationMgr. The context must be initialized by an external client. It is assumed that the
SetName is provided by the user e.g. as an input argument to main() or as an environment
variable.
• IProperty interface. Clients wishing to use the setMyProperties method must implement this
interface.
• OptionsArchive. An archive is needed for previously defined sets of options. For example this
could be a set of text files, or a database.
• OptionsEditor. An editor is needed to edit the set of options. For example this could be a text
editor, or a database editor.

Event Selector
The event selector allows an end user to select, on the basis of physical properties, which
events will be processed by an application. The event selector is the component which
knows what is the next event to be processed.

interfaces it offers to other components and its dependencies.

Event Selector
52 GAUDI
8.1 Purpose and Functionality
The event selector (EventSelector) component is able to produce a list of events from a given set of
“selection criteria”. In general, for batch oriented applications, it is the ApplicationMgr that provides
the “selection criteria” to the EventSelector. For interactive applications, it is required that the end
user has the possibility to interact directly with the EventSelector by means of the UserInterface
component. The complexity of the “selection criteria” can vary from very simple to very
sophisticated involving looking at the event data and running some selection code to decide whether
the event is selected or not. Here are some examples of “selection criteria”:
• All the events of a given run number or within a range of run numbers.
• All the events between two dates that belong to a certain event classification.
• A discrete list of run number, event number pairs.
• All the events of a given persistent “event collection” identified by a name.
• A complex SQL query in the event data ODBMS.
• etc.
The EventSelector provides one or more iterator types to be used by the ApplicationMgr. It is the role
of the ApplicationMgr to enquire of the EventSelector which is the next event to be processed and to
setup correctly the corresponding data stores with that information. The EventSelector does not
necessarily need to have in memory all the handles of the selected events since event selections could
be very big.
It is not the role of the EventSelector to create persistent “event collections”. These collections are
created by specialized applications called “event selection applications”. The purpose of these
applications is to processes events from some general collections (i.e. runs), apply physics Algorithms
and select only those events that pass all the physics selection criteria, and finally to create an “event
collection” as output.
Responsibilities
• The EventSelector must be capable of examining data from any of the possible sources e.g. data
stored in an Objectivity database, data stored in ZEBRA format on tape etc.
• The EventSelector will accept user defined selection function objects.
8.2 Interfaces
The EventSelector provides the following interfaces:
• Event selection interface (IEvtSelector). This interface is used to tell the selector what is the
selection criteria, declare user selection functions, and obtain references to iterators.
• Selection user interface (ISelectorUI). This is the interface used by the UserInterface component
which allows the end user to interact with the selector.
• Properties interface (IProperty). This interface allows other components to modify the default
behavior of the EventSelector by assigning new values to its properties.

Transient Data Store
56 GAUDI
9.1 Purpose and Functionality
We envisage several transient data stores within one application, each characterized by the lifetime
and nature of the contained data. For example, there is the Transient Event Data Store for event data,
the Transient Detector Data Store for detector, alignment and calibration data, and the Transient
Histogram Data Store for histograms and other “statistics based” objects.
A Transient Data Store is managed by a Data service, for example the Transient Event Data Store is
managed by the Transient Event Data Service (EventDataSvc). This service implements an interface
which is used by clients and in particular by Algorithms to access the data within the store. In order to
find required data it is assumed that a client knows how the data is organized, and identified and
obeys the relevant ownership conventions. Key issues related to transient stores are:
• Data Organization. The data within a data store is organized as tree, see Section 3.4.
• Data Identification. Any data object in the data store has an identifier, allowing it to be refered-to
by a client [Section 3.4].
• Data ownership. Data objects within a data store are owned by the data service that is managing
that store. In particular if a new data object is created by a client and registered into the store so as
to make it available to other algorithms then that client is no longer responsible for the deletion of
the object. Infact after registration they must not delete the object or change essential
characteristics such as the identification, etc..
• Lifetime. References to objects in the data stores are valid only during a specific (store
dependent) time span. For example, references to event data objects become invalid
immeadiately the next event is loaded.
9.2 Interfaces
The Transient Data Store does not offer any interface directly to clients. The interface is implemented
by the corresponding Data Service. Clients of a Transient Data Store are allowed to keep direct
references to objects in the store as long as the validity period and ownership conventions are obeyed.
9.3 Dependencies
Since the Transient Data Store is a passive component it does not need any other component of the
system to perform its function (storing data objects is memory).

Event Data Service
60 GAUDI
10.1 Purpose and Functionality
The event data service manages the transient event data store. The service interacts mainly with two
components: Algorithms and the ApplicationMgr.
• The event data service is used by the Algorithms as an input/output channel for data objects. An
algorithm may request objects from the store, or register them into the store so that they are
available to other algorithms.
• The event data service delivers references to event data objects on request. If the requested
data objects are not present, the event data service asks the event persistency service to load
the required objects and then makes them availible to the algorithm.
• Once event data objects are registered to the event data service, the algorithm gives up
ownership. The event data service releases the objects on request of the application manager.
• Event data objects must be identifiable in order to be added to the data store.
• The registration of data must respect the tree structure of the transient store.
• The application manager tells the event data service which event to deal with in case of a request.
• Clients of the event data service can decide which data should be made persistent:
• Clients may decide to discard partially or completely the data objects managed by the service.
• The event data service must be able to deliver transient data objects to the services in charge
of creating other data representations like the persistency service or the service responsible
for creating graphical representations.
10.2 Interfaces
The EventDataSvc implements the following interfaces:
• Generic service interface (IService) for specific interaction like e.g. query the service name.
• Storage management (IDataManagerSvc): This interface supplies global management actions
on the transient data store. This interface is used by the ApplicationMgr. Through this interface
actions necessary to manipulate event related data globally, such as requests to load a new event,
discard the objects owned by the service etc. are handled. The interface also allows selection
collectors using selection agents to traverse through the data store.
• Data provider (IDataProviderSvc): The interface used by the Algorithms to request or register
event data objects.

10.3 Dependencies
The EventDataSvc depends on the following services provided by other components of the
architecture :
• The generic service (Service) implementation which defines basic properties and abilities of any
service.
• Job options service (JobOptionsSvc). The JobOptionsSvc service provides to the EventDataSvc
the new values for the its properties in case the user would like to overwrite the default ones. The
implementation of the event data service only depends on the interface of the job option service.
• Message service (MessageSvc). The EventDataSvc uses the MessageSvc to report errors and
informational messages to the end user. The implementation of the event data service only
depends on the interface of the message service.
• Event persistency service (EvtPersistencySvc). The EventDataSvc uses the persistency service to
create transient objects on demand. The implementation of the event data service only depends on
the interface of the persistency service.
• Data selection agents (ISelectionAgent). Data selector agents are used to traverse the data store in
order to analyse the content e.g. to collect references to objects which should be passed to other
services.
GAUDI 63

Event Persistency Service
The event persistency service delivers data objects from a persistent store to the transient
data store and vice versa. The persistency service collaborates with the event data service to
provide the data requested by an algorithm in the case that the data is not yet in the transient
store. This service requires the help of specific converters which actually perform the
conversion of data objects between their transient and persistent representations.

Event Persistency Service
64 GAUDI
11.1 Purpose and Functionality
The purpose of the event persistency service (EvtPersistencySvc) is the extraction of persistent
objects from the persistent data store and their conversion to the appropriate transient types, and the
inverse process.
The creation of a transient object proceeds as follows:
• given an identifier, the service locates the object in the persistent world,
• the appropriate Converter for this type is selected,
• the persistency service invokes the converter and finally
• delivers the requested transient object to the client.
The object identifier needs only to be interpreted by the Converter, it is not needed anywhere outside
the converter.
If it is known in advance that not a single object, but instead a complete tree or part of a tree of data is
required, then the service can optimize the procedure. For example, sub-trees or a list of objects
required in every event may be specified to the persistency service and the objects “pre-loaded”
before they are requested by an algorithm.
To populate the persistent data store is slightly different:
• the persistency service is given transient objects,
• it finds the proper converter for the received object,
• it invokes the object conversion using this converter and
• stores the persistent object.,
Converters being able to create persistent representations must be assigned to the service either one
by one or in the form of a factory.
Converters are declared to the EvtPersistencySvc at run-time and therefore they need to implement a
common interface. The Converters know about the mechanism to retrieve persistent objects (e.g.
from ZEBRA, Objy,...) and to create their transient representation and vice-versa. Identifying which
Converter is able to convert a specific instance is achieved by associating each Converter to a unique
run-time independent class identifier.
11.2 Interfaces
The EvtPersistencySvc provides the following interfaces:
• Generic service interface (IService) for interactions such as querying the service name.
• Generic data conversion interface (IConversionSvc). This interface is capable to accept
converters or a converter factory necessary to create persistent event data representations. This
interface also accepts data selectors which tell the service which objects have to be created,
converted or updated.
• Persistency specific interface (IPersistencySvc). This interface will handle - if needed - specific
interactions with the persistent store.

DetPersistencySvc to load or update detector objects in to store. The implementation of the event
data persistency service only depends on the interfaces of the data service.
• Data item selectors (DataItemSelector). If persistent data must be updated or new persistent
objects must be created an object selection is passed to the service in form of a selected item
collection. The service will retrieve all selected items from the selector.

Detector Data Service
The detector data service manages the transient detector data store. This component is very
similar to the event data service with regards to the retrieval and registration of data objects.

Detector Data Service
68 GAUDI
12.1 Purpose and Functionality
The detector data service manages the transient detector data store. The service interacts with several
other components: the application manager, algorithms and event data converters whenever event
data structures have references to detector data.
Besides providing requested data, the detector data service also has to check the validity of the data
since detector data are not “static” over the entire lifetime of a job. For example calibration constants
will change with time and the set of constants which is valid for the first events in the job may not be
valid for last events. Hence the detector data service must be able to distinguish between valid and
invalid data with respect to a given event.
Invalid data may be discarded or updated, i.e. given a valid time stamp the detector data service must:
• direct new detector data requests to the proper, valid data objects.
• request the loading of up-to-date detector data objects if they are not present in the store.
Algorithms will initialize references to detector data at configuration time. These references must stay
valid over the analyzed event range and so the objects will have to be updated rather than recreated.
This means, that the detector data service is not stateless. It will have to be validated for every event
ensuring that the contained references are valid. In order to optimize data validity the detector data
objects which should automatically be updated must be marked.
• The detector data service is used by the algorithms as an input/output channel for detector data
objects:
• The detector data service delivers references to detector data objects on request. If the
requested data objects are not present, the detector data service asks the detector persistency
service to deliver the objects and makes them available to the algorithm.
• Detector data objects intended to be available to (other) algorithms must be registered to the
detector data service.
• Once detector data objects are registered to the detector data service, the algorithm gives up
ownership. The detector data service releases the objects at the request of the application
manager.
• Detector data objects must be identifiable in order to be added to the data store.
• The registration of data must follow the hierarchy of the detector data objects.
• Clients of the detector data service can decide which data should be made persistent:
• Clients may decide to discard partially or completely the data objects managed by the service.

STATE AID DEADLINES

We recommend that you complete and submit your FAFSA as soon as possible on or
after January 1, 2014. If you (or your parents) need to file a 2013 income tax return with
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and have not done so yet, you can submit your FAFSA
now using estimated tax information, and then you must correct that information after
you file your return.
The easiest way to complete or correct your FAFSA with accurate tax information is by
using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool through www.fafsa.gov. In a few simple steps, most
students and parents who filed a 2013 tax return can view and transfer their tax return
information directly into their FAFSA.
Note: Both parents or both the student and spouse may need to report income
information on the FAFSA if they did not file a joint tax return for 2013. For assistance with
answering the income information questions in this situation, call 1-800-4-FED-AID.

Notes for question 53 (page 5)

Notes for Step Four, questions 59–94 (pages 6 and 7)

Answer “Yes” if at any time since you turned age 13:

3FWJFXBMMinstructionsCFMPXUPEFUFSNJOFXho is considered a parent

t You had no living parent (biological or adoptive), even if you are now
adopted; or
t You were in foster care, even if you are no longer in foster care today;
or
t You were a dependent or ward of the court, even if you are no longer
a dependent or ward of the court today. For federal student aid
purposes, someone who is incarcerated is not considered a ward of
the court.
The financial aid administrator at your school may require you to provide
proof that you were in foster care or a dependent or ward of the court.

Notes for questions 54 and 55 (page 5)
The definition of legal guardianship does not include your parents, even
if they were appointed by a court to be your guardians. You are also not
considered a legal guardian of yourself.
Answer “Yes” if you can provide a copy of a court’s decision that as of
today you are an emancipated minor or are in legal guardianship. Also
answer “Yes” if you can provide a copy of a court’s decision that you were
an emancipated minor or were in legal guardianship immediately before
you reached the age of being an adult in your state. The court must be
located in your state of legal residence at the time the court’s decision
was issued.
Answer “No” if you are still a minor and the court decision is no longer
in effect or the court decision was not in effect at the time you became
an adult.
The financial aid administrator at your college may require you to provide
proof that you were an emancipated minor or in legal guardianship.

Notes for questions 56–58 (page 5)
Answer “Yes” if you received a determination at any time on or after
July 1, 2013, that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless
or at risk of being homeless.
t “Homeless” means lacking fixed, regular and adequate housing. You
may be homeless if you are living in shelters, parks, motels or cars, or
are temporarily living with other people because you have nowhere
else to go. Also, if you are living in any of these situations and fleeing
an abusive parent you may be considered homeless even if your
parent would provide support and a place to live.
t “Unaccompanied” means you are not living in the physical custody
of your parent or guardian.
t “Youth” means you are 21 years of age or younger or you are still
enrolled in high school as of the day you sign this application.
Answer “No” if you are not homeless or at risk of being homeless, or do
not have a determination. You should contact your financial aid office
for assistance if you do not have a determination but believe you are an
unaccompanied youth who is homeless or are an unaccompanied youth
providing for your own living expenses who is at risk of being homeless.
The financial aid administrator at your college may require you to
provide a copy of the determination if you answered “Yes” to any of
these questions.

Notes for students unable to provide parental information on
pages 6 and 7
Under very limited circumstances (for example, your parents are
incarcerated; you have left home due to an abusive family environment;
or you do not know where your parents are and are unable to contact
them), you may be able to submit your FAFSA without parental
information. If you are unable to provide parental information, skip
Steps Four and Five, and go to Step Six. Once you submit your FAFSA
without parental data, you must follow up with the financial aid office
at the college you plan to attend, in order to complete your FAFSA.

DPVQMF SFTJEFT. If your legal parents are divorced but living
together, select “Unmarriedand both parentsliving together.” If
your legal parents are separated but living together, select
“Married or remarried,” not “Divorced or separated.”
t If your parents are divorced or separated, answer the questions about
the parent you lived with more during the past 12 months. (If you did
not live with one parent more than the other, give answers about
the parent who provided more financial support during the past 12
months or during the most recent year that you actually received
support from a parent.) If this parent is remarried as of today, answer
the questions about that parent and your stepparent.
t If your widowed parent is remarried as of today, answer the questions
about that parent and your stepparent.

Notes for questions 84 (page 6)
and 102 (page 8)
In general, a person may be considered a dislocated worker if he or she:
t is receiving unemployment benefits due to being laid off or losing a
job and is unlikely to return to a previous occupation;
t has been laid off or received a lay-off notice from a job;
t was self-employed but is now unemployed due to economic
conditions or natural disaster; or
t is a displaced homemaker. A displaced homemaker is generally a
person who previously provided unpaid services to the family (e.g., a
stay-at-home mom or dad), is no longer supported by the husband or
wife, is unemployed or underemployed, and is having trouble finding
or upgrading employment.
If a person quits work, generally he or she is not considered a dislocated
worker even if, for example, the person is receiving unemployment
benefits.
Answer “Yes” to question 84 if your parent is a dislocated worker. Answer
“Yes” to question 102 if you or your spouse is a dislocated worker.
Answer “No” to question 84 if your parent is not a dislocated worker.
Answer “No” to question 102 if neither you nor your spouse is a dislocated
worker.
Answer “Don’t know” to question 84 if you are not sure whether your
parent is a dislocated worker. Answer “Don’t know” to question 102 if
you are not sure whether you or your spouse is a dislocated worker. You
can contact your financial aid office for assistance in answering these
questions.
The financial aid administrator at your college may require you to
provide proof that your parent is a dislocated worker, if you answered
“Yes” to question 84, or that you or your spouse is a dislocated worker, if
you answered “Yes” to question 102.

What is the FAFSA ?

Information on the Privacy Act and use of your
Social Security Number

Why fill out a FAFSA?

We use the information that you provide on this form to determine if you are
eligible to receive federal student financial aid and the amount that you are
eligible to receive. Sections 483 and 484 of the Higher Education Act of 1965,
as amended, give us the authority to ask you and your parents these questions,
and to collect the Social Security Numbers of you and your parents. We use your
Social Security Number to verify your identity and retrieve your records, and we
may request your Social Security Number again for those purposes.

SM

The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the first step in the
financial aid process. You use the FAFSA to apply for federal student aid, such
as grants, loans and work-study. In addition, most states and colleges use
information from the FAFSA to award nonfederal aid.

Why all the questions?
The questions on the FAFSA are required to calculate your Expected Family
Contribution (EFC). The EFC measures your family’s financial strength and is
used to determine your eligibility for federal student aid. Your state and the
colleges you list may also use some of your responses. They will determine if
you may be eligible for school or state aid, in addition to federal aid.

How do I find out what my Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is?
Your EFC will be listed on your Student Aid Report (SAR). Your SAR summarizes
the information you submitted on your FAFSA. It is important to review your SAR
to make sure all of your information is correct and complete. Make corrections
or provide additional information, as necessary.

State and institutional student financial aid programs may also use the
information that you provide on this form to determine if you are eligible to
receive state and institutional aid and the need that you have for such aid.
Therefore, we will disclose the information that you provide on this form to
each institution you list in questions 103a - 103h, state agencies in your state of
legal residence and the state agencies of the states in which the colleges that
you list in questions 103a - 103h are located.

How much aid will I receive?

If you are applying solely for federal aid, you must answer all of the following
questions that apply to you: 1-9, 14-16, 18, 21-23, 26, 28-29, 32-37, 39-59, 61-68,
70, 73-86, 88-102, 104-105. If you do not answer these questions, you will not
receive federal aid.

Using the information on your FAFSA and your EFC, the financial aid office at
your college will determine the amount of aid you will receive. The college will
use your EFC to prepare a financial aid package to help you meet your financial
need. Financial need is the difference between your EFC and your college’s
cost of attendance (which can include living expenses), as determined by
the college. If you or your family have unusual circumstances that should be
taken into account, contact your college’s financial aid office. Some examples
of unusual circumstances are: unusual medical or dental expenses or a large
change in income from last year to this year.

Without your consent, we may disclose information that you provide to entities
under a published “routine use.” Under such a routine use, we may disclose
information to third parties that we have authorized to assist us in administering
the above programs; to other federal agencies under computer matching
programs, such as those with the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security
Administration, Selective Service System, Department of Homeland Security,
Department of Justice and Veterans Affairs; to your parents or spouse; and to
members of Congress if you ask them to help you with student aid questions.

When will I receive the aid?
Any financial aid you are eligible to receive will be paid to you through your
college. Typically, your college will first use the aid to pay tuition, fees and room
and board (if provided by the college). Any remaining aid is paid to you for your
other educational expenses. If you are eligible for a Federal Pell Grant, you may
receive it from only one college for the same period of enrollment.

How can I have more colleges receive my FAFSA information?
If you are completing a paper FAFSA, you can only list four colleges in the
school code step. You may add more colleges by doing one of the following:
1. Use the Federal Student Aid PIN you will receive after your FAFSA has been
processed and go to FAFSA on the Web at www.fafsa.gov. Click the “Login”
button on the home page to log in to FAFSA on the Web, then click “Make
FAFSA Corrections.”
2. Use the Student Aid Report (SAR), which you will receive after your FAFSA is
processed. Your Data Release Number (DRN) verifies your identity and will
be listed on the first page of your SAR. You can call 1-800-4-FED-AID and
provide your DRN to a customer service representative, who will add more
school codes for you.
3. Provide your DRN to the financial aid administrator at the college you want
added, and he or she can add their school code to your FAFSA.
Note: Your FAFSA record can only list up to ten school codes. If there are ten
school codes on your record, any new school codes that you add will replace
one or more of the school codes listed.

Where can I receive more information on student aid?
The best place for information about student financial aid is the financial aid
office at the college you plan to attend. The financial aid administrator can tell
you about student aid available from your state, the college itself and other
sources.
t You can also visit our web site StudentAid.gov.
t For information by phone you can call our Federal Student Aid Information
Center at 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243). TTY users (for the hearing
impaired) may call 1-800-730-8913.
t You can also check with your high school counselor, your state aid agency
or your local library’s reference section.
Information about other nonfederal assistance may be available from foundations,
religious organizations, community organizations and civic groups, as well as
organizations related to your field of interest, such as the American Medical
Association or American Bar Association. Check with your parents’ employers or
unions to see if they award scholarships or have tuition payment plans.

Page 10

If the federal government, the U.S. Department of Education, or an employee
of the U.S. Department of Education is involved in litigation, we may send
information to the Department of Justice, or a court or adjudicative body, if the
disclosure is related to financial aid and certain conditions are met. In addition,
we may send your information to a foreign, federal, state, or local enforcement
agency if the information that you submitted indicates a violation or potential
violation of law, for which that agency has jurisdiction for investigation
or prosecution. Finally, we may send information regarding a claim that is
determined to be valid and overdue to a consumer reporting agency. This
information includes identifiers from the record; the amount, status and history
of the claim; and the program under which the claim arose.
