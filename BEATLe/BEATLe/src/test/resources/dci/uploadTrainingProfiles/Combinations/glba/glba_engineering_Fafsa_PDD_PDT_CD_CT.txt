STATE AID DEADLINES

We recommend that you complete and submit your FAFSA as soon as possible on or
after January 1, 2014. If you (or your parents) need to file a 2013 income tax return with
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and have not done so yet, you can submit your FAFSA
now using estimated tax information, and then you must correct that information after
you file your return.
The easiest way to complete or correct your FAFSA with accurate tax information is by
using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool through www.fafsa.gov. In a few simple steps, most
students and parents who filed a 2013 tax return can view and transfer their tax return
information directly into their FAFSA.
Note: Both parents or both the student and spouse may need to report income
information on the FAFSA if they did not file a joint tax return for 2013. For assistance with
answering the income information questions in this situation, call 1-800-4-FED-AID.

APPLICATION DEADLINES
Federal Aid Deadline - June 30, 2015
State Aid Deadlines - See below.

Notes for question 8 (page 3)
Enter your Social Security Number (SSN). If you are a resident of the
Freely Associated States (i.e., the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the
Marshall Islands, or the Federated States of Micronesia) and were issued
an identification number beginning with “666” when submitting a FAFSA
previously, enter that number here. If you are a first-time applicant from
the Freely Associated States, enter “666” in the first three boxes of the
SSN field and leave the remaining six positions blank and we will create
an identification number to be used for federal student aid purposes.

Notes for questions 14 and 15 (page 3)
If you are an eligible noncitizen, write in your eight- or nine-digit Alien
Registration Number. Generally, you are an eligible noncitizen if you are
(1) a permanent U.S. resident with a Permanent Resident Card (I-551); (2)
a conditional permanent resident with a Conditional Green Card (I-551C);
(3) the holder of an Arrival-Departure Record (I-94) from the Department
of Homeland Security showing any one of the following designations:
“Refugee,” “Asylum Granted,” “Parolee” (I-94 confirms that you were
paroled for a minimum of one year and status has not expired), T-Visa
holder (T-1, T-2, T-3, etc.) or “Cuban-Haitian Entrant;” or (4) the holder of a
valid certification or eligibility letter from the Department of Health and
Human Services showing a designation of “Victim of human trafficking.”
If you are in the U.S. on an F1 or F2 student visa, a J1 or J2 exchange
visitor visa, or a G series visa (pertaining to international organizations),
select “No, I am not a citizen or eligible noncitizen.” You will not be
eligible for federal student aid. If you have a Social Security Number but
are not a citizen or an eligible noncitizen, you should still complete the
FAFSA because you may be eligible for state or college aid.

Notes for questions 16 and 17 (page 3)
Report your marital status as of the date you sign your FAFSA. If your
marital status changes after you sign your FAFSA, check with the
financial aid office at the college. Consistent with the Supreme Court
decision IPMEJOH 4FDUJPO  PG the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)
VODPOTUJUVUJPOBM, same-sex couples must report their marital status as
married if they were legally married in a state or other jurisdiction
(foreign country) that permits same-sex marriage XJUIPVU SFHBSE UP
XIFSFUIFDPVQMFSFTJEFT.

Notes for question 22 (page 3)
The Selective Service System, and the registration requirement for young
men, preserves America’s ability to provide manpower in an emergency
to the U.S. Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines or Coast
Guard). Almost all men—ages 18 through 25—must register. For more
information about Selective Service, visit www.sss.gov.

Notes for questions 33 (page 4)
and 81 (page 6)

Notes for questions 42 and 43 (page 4), 45j (page 5),

own entrance, kitchen, and bath rented to someone other than a family
member), trust funds, UGMA and UTMA accounts, money market funds,
mutual funds, certificates of deposit, stocks, stock options, bonds, other
securities, installment and land sale contracts (including mortgages
held), commodities, etc.
Investments also include qualified educational benefits or education
savings accounts (e.g., Coverdell savings accounts, 529 college savings
plans and the refund value of 529 prepaid tuition plans). For a student
who does not report parental information, the accounts owned by the
student (and/or the student’s spouse) are reported as student investments
in question 42. For a student who must report parental information, the
accounts are reported as parental investments in question 91, including
all accounts owned by the student and all accounts owned by the parents
for any member of the household.
Money received, or paid on your behalf, also includes distributions to
you (the student beneficiary) from a 529 plan that is owned by someone
other than you or your parents (such as your grandparents, aunts, and
uncles). You must include these distribution amounts in question 45j.
Investments do not include the home you live in, the value of life
insurance, retirement plans (401[k] plans, pension funds, annuities, noneducation IRAs, Keogh plans, etc.) or cash, savings and checking accounts
already reported in questions 41 and 90.
Investments also do not include UGMA and UTMA accounts for which
you are the custodian, but not the owner.
Investment value means the current balance or market value of these
investments as of today. Investment debt means only those debts that
are related to the investments.
Business and/or investment farm value includes the market value of
land, buildings, machinery, equipment, inventory, etc. Business and/or
investment farm debt means only those debts for which the business or
investment farm was used as collateral.
Business value does not include the value of a small business if your
family owns and controls more than 50 percent of the business and the
business has 100 or fewer full-time or full-time equivalent employees.
For small business value, your family includes (1) persons directly related
to you, such as a parent, sister or cousin, or (2) persons who are or were
related to you by marriage, such as a spouse, stepparent or sister-in-law.
Investment farm value does not include the value of a family farm that
you (your spouse and/or your parents) live on and operate.

If you filed or will file a foreign tax return, a tax return with Puerto Rico,
another U.S. territory (e.g., Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin
Islands, Swain’s Island or the Northern Marianas Islands) or one of the
Freely Associated States, use the information from that return to fill out
this form. If you filed a foreign return, convert all monetary units to U.S.
dollars, using the exchange rate that is in effect today. To view the daily
exchange rate, go to www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/current.

Notes for question 49 (page 5)

Notes for questions 35 (page 4)

Notes for question 50 (page 5)

In general, a person is eligible to file a 1040A or 1040EZ if he or she makes less
than $100,000, does not itemize deductions, does not receive income from
his or her own business or farm and does not receive alimony. A person is
not eligible to file a 1040A or 1040EZ if he or she makes $100,000 or more,
itemizes deductions, receives income from his or her own business or farm,
is self-employed, receives alimony or is required to file Schedule D for capital
gains. If you filed a 1040 only to claim the American Opportunity Tax Credit or
Lifetime Learning Tax Credit, and you would have otherwise been eligible to
file a 1040A or 1040EZ, answer “Yes” to this question. If you filed a 1040 and
were not required to file a tax return, answer “Yes” to this question.

Notes for questions 38 (page 4)
and 87 (page 7) — Notes for those who filed a 1040EZ
On the 1040EZ, if a person didn’t check either box on line 5, enter 01 if he or
she is single or has never been married, or 02 if he or she is married. If a person
checked either the “you” or “spouse” box on line 5, use 1040EZ worksheet line

Notes for question 53 (page 5)

Notes for Step Four, questions 59–94 (pages 6 and 7)

Answer “Yes” if at any time since you turned age 13:

3FWJFXBMMinstructionsCFMPXUPEFUFSNJOFXho is considered a parent

t You had no living parent (biological or adoptive), even if you are now
adopted; or
t You were in foster care, even if you are no longer in foster care today;
or
t You were a dependent or ward of the court, even if you are no longer
a dependent or ward of the court today. For federal student aid
purposes, someone who is incarcerated is not considered a ward of
the court.
The financial aid administrator at your school may require you to provide
proof that you were in foster care or a dependent or ward of the court.

Notes for questions 54 and 55 (page 5)
The definition of legal guardianship does not include your parents, even
if they were appointed by a court to be your guardians. You are also not
considered a legal guardian of yourself.
Answer “Yes” if you can provide a copy of a court’s decision that as of
today you are an emancipated minor or are in legal guardianship. Also
answer “Yes” if you can provide a copy of a court’s decision that you were
an emancipated minor or were in legal guardianship immediately before
you reached the age of being an adult in your state. The court must be
located in your state of legal residence at the time the court’s decision
was issued.
Answer “No” if you are still a minor and the court decision is no longer
in effect or the court decision was not in effect at the time you became
an adult.
The financial aid administrator at your college may require you to provide
proof that you were an emancipated minor or in legal guardianship.

Notes for questions 56–58 (page 5)
Answer “Yes” if you received a determination at any time on or after
July 1, 2013, that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless
or at risk of being homeless.
t “Homeless” means lacking fixed, regular and adequate housing. You
may be homeless if you are living in shelters, parks, motels or cars, or
are temporarily living with other people because you have nowhere
else to go. Also, if you are living in any of these situations and fleeing
an abusive parent you may be considered homeless even if your
parent would provide support and a place to live.
t “Unaccompanied” means you are not living in the physical custody
of your parent or guardian.
t “Youth” means you are 21 years of age or younger or you are still
enrolled in high school as of the day you sign this application.
Answer “No” if you are not homeless or at risk of being homeless, or do
not have a determination. You should contact your financial aid office
for assistance if you do not have a determination but believe you are an
unaccompanied youth who is homeless or are an unaccompanied youth
providing for your own living expenses who is at risk of being homeless.
The financial aid administrator at your college may require you to
provide a copy of the determination if you answered “Yes” to any of
these questions.

Notes for students unable to provide parental information on
pages 6 and 7
Under very limited circumstances (for example, your parents are
incarcerated; you have left home due to an abusive family environment;
or you do not know where your parents are and are unable to contact
them), you may be able to submit your FAFSA without parental
information. If you are unable to provide parental information, skip
Steps Four and Five, and go to Step Six. Once you submit your FAFSA
without parental data, you must follow up with the financial aid office
at the college you plan to attend, in order to complete your FAFSA.

t If your legal parents (biological and/or adoptive) are not married to
each other and live together, select “Unmarried and both parents
living together” and provide information about both of them
regardless of their gender. Do not include any person who is not
married to your parent and who is not a legal or biological parent.
Contact 1-800-4-FED-AID for assistance in completing questions
80-94.
t If your parents are married, select “Married or remarried.”
Consistentwith the Supreme Court decision IPMEJOH4FDUJPOPG

couples must report their marital status as married if they were
legally married in a state or other jurisdiction (foreign country)
that permits same-sex marriage XJUIPVU SFHBSE UP XIFSF UIF
DPVQMF SFTJEFT. If your legal parents are divorced but living
together, select “Unmarriedand both parentsliving together.” If
your legal parents are separated but living together, select
“Married or remarried,” not “Divorced or separated.”
t If your parents are divorced or separated, answer the questions about
the parent you lived with more during the past 12 months. (If you did
not live with one parent more than the other, give answers about
the parent who provided more financial support during the past 12
months or during the most recent year that you actually received
support from a parent.) If this parent is remarried as of today, answer
the questions about that parent and your stepparent.
t If your widowed parent is remarried as of today, answer the questions
about that parent and your stepparent.

Notes for questions 84 (page 6)
and 102 (page 8)
In general, a person may be considered a dislocated worker if he or she:
t is receiving unemployment benefits due to being laid off or losing a
job and is unlikely to return to a previous occupation;
t has been laid off or received a lay-off notice from a job;
t was self-employed but is now unemployed due to economic
conditions or natural disaster; or
t is a displaced homemaker. A displaced homemaker is generally a
person who previously provided unpaid services to the family (e.g., a
stay-at-home mom or dad), is no longer supported by the husband or
wife, is unemployed or underemployed, and is having trouble finding
or upgrading employment.
If a person quits work, generally he or she is not considered a dislocated
worker even if, for example, the person is receiving unemployment
benefits.
Answer “Yes” to question 84 if your parent is a dislocated worker. Answer
“Yes” to question 102 if you or your spouse is a dislocated worker.
Answer “No” to question 84 if your parent is not a dislocated worker.
Answer “No” to question 102 if neither you nor your spouse is a dislocated
worker.
Answer “Don’t know” to question 84 if you are not sure whether your
parent is a dislocated worker. Answer “Don’t know” to question 102 if
you are not sure whether you or your spouse is a dislocated worker. You
can contact your financial aid office for assistance in answering these
questions.
The financial aid administrator at your college may require you to
provide proof that your parent is a dislocated worker, if you answered
“Yes” to question 84, or that you or your spouse is a dislocated worker, if
you answered “Yes” to question 102.

What is the FAFSA ?

Information on the Privacy Act and use of your
Social Security Number

Why fill out a FAFSA?

We use the information that you provide on this form to determine if you are
eligible to receive federal student financial aid and the amount that you are
eligible to receive. Sections 483 and 484 of the Higher Education Act of 1965,
as amended, give us the authority to ask you and your parents these questions,
and to collect the Social Security Numbers of you and your parents. We use your
Social Security Number to verify your identity and retrieve your records, and we
may request your Social Security Number again for those purposes.

SM

The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the first step in the
financial aid process. You use the FAFSA to apply for federal student aid, such
as grants, loans and work-study. In addition, most states and colleges use
information from the FAFSA to award nonfederal aid.

Why all the questions?
The questions on the FAFSA are required to calculate your Expected Family
Contribution (EFC). The EFC measures your family’s financial strength and is
used to determine your eligibility for federal student aid. Your state and the
colleges you list may also use some of your responses. They will determine if
you may be eligible for school or state aid, in addition to federal aid.

How do I find out what my Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is?
Your EFC will be listed on your Student Aid Report (SAR). Your SAR summarizes
the information you submitted on your FAFSA. It is important to review your SAR
to make sure all of your information is correct and complete. Make corrections
or provide additional information, as necessary.

State and institutional student financial aid programs may also use the
information that you provide on this form to determine if you are eligible to
receive state and institutional aid and the need that you have for such aid.
Therefore, we will disclose the information that you provide on this form to
each institution you list in questions 103a - 103h, state agencies in your state of
legal residence and the state agencies of the states in which the colleges that
you list in questions 103a - 103h are located.

How much aid will I receive?

If you are applying solely for federal aid, you must answer all of the following
questions that apply to you: 1-9, 14-16, 18, 21-23, 26, 28-29, 32-37, 39-59, 61-68,
70, 73-86, 88-102, 104-105. If you do not answer these questions, you will not
receive federal aid.

Using the information on your FAFSA and your EFC, the financial aid office at
your college will determine the amount of aid you will receive. The college will
use your EFC to prepare a financial aid package to help you meet your financial
need. Financial need is the difference between your EFC and your college’s
cost of attendance (which can include living expenses), as determined by
the college. If you or your family have unusual circumstances that should be
taken into account, contact your college’s financial aid office. Some examples
of unusual circumstances are: unusual medical or dental expenses or a large
change in income from last year to this year.

Without your consent, we may disclose information that you provide to entities
under a published “routine use.” Under such a routine use, we may disclose
information to third parties that we have authorized to assist us in administering
the above programs; to other federal agencies under computer matching
programs, such as those with the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security
Administration, Selective Service System, Department of Homeland Security,
Department of Justice and Veterans Affairs; to your parents or spouse; and to
members of Congress if you ask them to help you with student aid questions.

When will I receive the aid?
Any financial aid you are eligible to receive will be paid to you through your
college. Typically, your college will first use the aid to pay tuition, fees and room
and board (if provided by the college). Any remaining aid is paid to you for your
other educational expenses. If you are eligible for a Federal Pell Grant, you may
receive it from only one college for the same period of enrollment.

How can I have more colleges receive my FAFSA information?
If you are completing a paper FAFSA, you can only list four colleges in the
school code step. You may add more colleges by doing one of the following:
1. Use the Federal Student Aid PIN you will receive after your FAFSA has been
processed and go to FAFSA on the Web at www.fafsa.gov. Click the “Login”
button on the home page to log in to FAFSA on the Web, then click “Make
FAFSA Corrections.”
2. Use the Student Aid Report (SAR), which you will receive after your FAFSA is
processed. Your Data Release Number (DRN) verifies your identity and will
be listed on the first page of your SAR. You can call 1-800-4-FED-AID and
provide your DRN to a customer service representative, who will add more
school codes for you.
3. Provide your DRN to the financial aid administrator at the college you want
added, and he or she can add their school code to your FAFSA.
Note: Your FAFSA record can only list up to ten school codes. If there are ten
school codes on your record, any new school codes that you add will replace
one or more of the school codes listed.

Where can I receive more information on student aid?
The best place for information about student financial aid is the financial aid
office at the college you plan to attend. The financial aid administrator can tell
you about student aid available from your state, the college itself and other
sources.
t You can also visit our web site StudentAid.gov.
t For information by phone you can call our Federal Student Aid Information
Center at 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243). TTY users (for the hearing
impaired) may call 1-800-730-8913.
t You can also check with your high school counselor, your state aid agency
or your local library’s reference section.
Information about other nonfederal assistance may be available from foundations,
religious organizations, community organizations and civic groups, as well as
organizations related to your field of interest, such as the American Medical
Association or American Bar Association. Check with your parents’ employers or
unions to see if they award scholarships or have tuition payment plans.

Page 10

If the federal government, the U.S. Department of Education, or an employee
of the U.S. Department of Education is involved in litigation, we may send
information to the Department of Justice, or a court or adjudicative body, if the
disclosure is related to financial aid and certain conditions are met. In addition,
we may send your information to a foreign, federal, state, or local enforcement
agency if the information that you submitted indicates a violation or potential
violation of law, for which that agency has jurisdiction for investigation
or prosecution. Finally, we may send information regarding a claim that is
determined to be valid and overdue to a consumer reporting agency. This
information includes identifiers from the record; the amount, status and history
of the claim; and the program under which the claim arose.
