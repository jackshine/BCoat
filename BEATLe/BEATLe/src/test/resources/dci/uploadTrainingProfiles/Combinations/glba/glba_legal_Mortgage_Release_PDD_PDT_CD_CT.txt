The document may be obtained from county, state and federal levels of government. Depending on your purposes, a local or state level may be sufficient, or you might need to provide the nationwide Criminal Background Check. We also had experience, where foreign government required both state and federal level background check to be provided by the applicant.Local and state levels are issued by a number of law enforcement agencies in a state of your residency such as Department of Public Safety, State Police or Department of Law Enforcement, while the federal or nationwide background check is issued only by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).In terms of processing times, the local and state levels Criminal Background Checks are much easier and faster to obtain while the FBI Criminal Background Check may take up to sixteen (16) weeks to obtain. Also, depending on your jurisdiction, you may need to provide different amount of information and identification in order to obtain the document. Please expect to provide as the minimum, the following for the FBI Criminal Background (Record) Check:* Full name as in birth certificate + any know aliases* Date of birth* Place of birth* Address* Race* Social Security Number* Fingerprints* Notarized waiverYour local and state requirements may differ and must be adhered to accordingly.Personal Documents* Certified Birth CertificateWhen it comes to obtaining vital records from the United States with* Consent Letter for Minor Children to TravelWhenever a minor child has to travel outside of the United States, they may need a consent* Criminal Background CheckThere are literally thousands of reasons why you might need to obtain a Criminal Background Check, which will include immigration purposes* Divorce DecreeNot all states issue divorce certificate, in fact, only a limited number of states do so.
