The document may be obtained from county, state and federal levels of government. Depending on your purposes, a local or state level may be sufficient, or you might need to provide the nationwide Criminal Background Check. We also had experience, where foreign government required both state and federal level background check to be provided by the applicant.Local and state levels are issued by a number of law enforcement agencies in a state of your residency such as Department of Public Safety, State Police or Department of Law Enforcement, while the federal or nationwide background check is issued only by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).In terms of processing times, the local and state levels Criminal Background Checks are much easier and faster to obtain while the FBI Criminal Background Check may take up to sixteen (16) weeks to obtain. Also, depending on your jurisdiction, you may need to provide different amount of information and identification in order to obtain the document.
